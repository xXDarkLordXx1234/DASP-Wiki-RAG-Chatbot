   * Keywordgraph of pedocs is connected (has 1 connected component), no isolated nodes.
   * Removing common keywords appears to have no effect on nr of components, but reduces nr of edges significantly.
   * 517 inconsistent papers between opus and opus_autor. 3007 (!) including opus_sama_publisher.
   * Started on Chinese Whispers.

   * Implemented keyword based graph with: vertices = papers, edges = correlations, correlation = keyword in common, weight = number of correlations.
   * Graph has 1.5mill edges, which seems surprisingly high.
   * Reason is that some keywords are very common and form large complete components, "deutschland" alone forms component with ~850.000 edges.
   * May have to adjust graph as these keywords do not seem to be particularly significant, not sure how to determine significance of keywords though
   * Will analyze number of components and isolated nodes tomorrow.

Current problems:
   * DKPro still largely a mystery to me.
   * Need to figure out how to extract my results from "AnalysisEngine" in Richard&Shuo's JDBC adapter.
   * Haven't yet figured out a proper structure for the graphs. Custom classes for vertices and edges may be cleaner, but don't seem to make sense both for efficiency and avoiding redundancies.
   * Keyword graph appears to run somewhat "sluggish", will look for coding mishaps.
   * This wiki.

---++++ Previous to May 2012:

   * Reading on NLP
   * Installed Maven, DKPro, Treetagger etc.
   * Installed MySQL, entered pedocs, connected to Java (JDBC)
   * Built Co-Author Network
   * Ported to Richard&Shuo's JDBC code, not yet working.
   * Roughly analyzed the database, concerning eligibility of a keyword based graph
