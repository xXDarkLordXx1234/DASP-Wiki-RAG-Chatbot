   * Goethe Westend http://www.campuslocation-frankfurt.de/index.php?site=loc&subsite=westend (DIPF idee) (Hoersaalzentrum (1200 Sitzplaetze), 30 Konferenzaeumen, Banquet - Mensa?)

   * Lichtwiese Medienzentrum Darmstadt unfortunately has the capacity of 1050 participants.
      * *MiM*: Iryna pointed out that this might be just enough - please also check if they have the rooms for the 5 parallel sessions available (with up to 200 participants)
      * Important: the main conf. hotel should be within max. 30 min. walking distance from the conference venue.<p style="text-align:justify">

*Uppsala:* SAS discounted prices??

*21.10.13*

The Hotels around Lichtwiese: about 2-3 km away. Most of them are 3* hotels.

Goethe Westend Campus offer *to meet onsite* to see the building, the rooms and the restaurant (provide catering) and to meet the catering manager. We can offer *the date for the meeting.* They also gave the estimated price list for the rooms.
   * !MiM: Ok, I'm fine with going to Frankfurt to look at the place, but I'd first like to estimate if (from the financial perspective) this is a candidate. Could you please give more details on that? In general, could you maybe start a table-like overview of different venues with prices etc.? This would help a lot in seeing which information we already have.

*06.11.2013

Sheraton Frankfurt Airport Hotel doesn't have enough capacity to hold our Conference.

Messe sent us an offer, but without two days of workshops, they recommend us to rent the rooms in the nearby hotels, because they can let the Congress Center as the whole building, and for workshops it will be too expensive (according to them).

Some catering companies have already send us the calculations for the catering. They can be found in the attached table. The others are still awaited, and for some of the I need to pick food from the menu, because they can't do the aproximate Menu (Studentenwerk).

The draft Email to the Mayor's office is written, it's just needed to be approved, probably on Friday.

The Email to Lufthansa (for a letter of support) was sent. The answer will be after the 11th of November.

Lichtwiese Darmstadt after my email wrote to wait for some more time and to have some more patience.
