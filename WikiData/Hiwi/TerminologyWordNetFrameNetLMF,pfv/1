---++++Terminology in !WordNet, !FrameNet and LMF

---+++++WN terminology
   * lexeme: abstract pairing of meaning and form 
   * lemma: the base form that is conventionally used to represent a lexeme

(see: UKP LSM-slides)

---+++++FN terminology
   * lexeme: "any of the inflectional versions of a word, represented by the uninflected stem" 
   * lemma: "composed of one or more lexemes" (in order to handle MWEs)
   * lexical unit: "association between a lemma and a frame. Since lemmas are units of form and frames represent meaning, lexical units correspond roughly to dictionary senses"

(see: THE STRUCTURE OF THE FRAMENET DATABASE, Baker et al., 2003)

---+++++LMF terminology
   * lexeme: abstract unit generally associated with a set of forms sharing a common meaning
   * lexical entry: 
      * container for managing one or several forms and possibly one or several meanings in order to describe a lexeme
      * container for managing the Form and Sense classes
