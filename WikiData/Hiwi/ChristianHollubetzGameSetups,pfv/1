   * *Quizlet* http://quizlet.com/
      * Originally a platform for learning flashcards
      * They have two games: scatter and spacerace
      * Scatter: Q and A of some flashcards (8 cards = 16 words/phrases) are scattered randomly around
         * The user has to match Q and A by dragging one over the other
      * Spacerace: Q of the flashcard moves from left to right
         * The user has to type in the correct answer before the Q reaches the right border of the browser

   * *SCATTER*
      * Similar to Quizlet's scatter but with sense definitions
      * The user has to match definitions refering to the same meaning
      * Open question: How to encode non-alignments, i.e. senses that have no correspondence in the other resource
         * Maybe add two regions; user has to additionally decide if the pair has the same definition or not
         * Or some of the definitions can be left w/o alignment
