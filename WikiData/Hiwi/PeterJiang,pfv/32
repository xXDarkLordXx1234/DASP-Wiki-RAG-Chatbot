[[PeterJiangTimes][Time tracking]]

AGENDA
   * CREATE a database table to store the runs and performances of the classifier
   * Inception Events
   * !OpenNlpClassifier should make prediction for every token
   * Recommendation Sidebar Training Status using Web Socket
   * Try !OpenNlpNerClassifier - but insufficient training data?
   * Store tagged sequences in the !PredictionModel (might be useful for Active Learning)
   * MIRA and !DL4J Classifier don't work anymore - find out why
   * Cache the trained model of a classifier (and also selected classifiers) for next time the document is opened.


---++ 2017-11-07 Meeting
   * NEW CONTRACT
   * use websocket to show training status in recommendation sidebar
      * show if training or not
      * information about selected classifiers
   * In the long run it we should define interface to let user access external classifiers
   * Save which predictions have been rejected.

---++ 2017-10-24 Meeting
   * Store tagged sequences in the !PredictionModel
   * keep in mind that the active learning strategy could inherit from my strategies..
   * Investigate why there are different numbers of annotations for a token...
   * Investigate why most annotations for a token have the same confidence
   * Configure the number of recommendations for a classifier in a sidebar (for !OpenNlp, it must be configured at training time)

---++ 2017-10-17 Meeting
   * Meeting with Wei about Active Learning
   * Next tasks:
      * Extend the !PredictionModel to show multiple recommendations for a token, show n most confident results
      * Generate predictions earlier

---++ 2017-09-12 Meeting
   * Fix !RecommedationPage UI
   * Reactivate !DL4J
   * Talk about Thesis
   * IMLS Interface

---++ 2017-08-29 Meeting
   * Next tasks: Confusion Matrix heatmap, relative values, tooltip
   * Timesheets
   * next contract

---++ 2017-08-22 Meeting
   * Continue working on Confusion Matrix (maybe orient on !DefaultRefreshingView in Webanno !AgreementTable.html)
   * use germ & gum data, maybe we can find another dataset for chunking?

---++ 2017-08-15 Meeting
   * Continue working on enhancing !EvaluationPage

---++ 2017-08-02 Meeting
   * Try to identify why the recommmendation module is making the application slow
      * reduce the checks for Document change
      * measure time
   * make it possible to select feature for layer

---++ 2017-07-25 Meeting
   * new contract
   * handing over timesheets
   * Eclipse bug
   * !REC will work on the UI for recommendation configuration and provide new methods, I will adjust the recommendation module to the changes.
   * Verify that recommendation works for NER layer too.
   * Get a confidence for each prediction
   * The statistical recommender should overwrite the Stringmatcher if the confidence for the prediction is high enough.
   * Offtopic..Bachelor Thesis - possible topic?

---++ 2017-07-11 Meeting
   * fixed vanished sidebar problem
   * Combine predictions from String Matching and another classifier
  
---++ 2017-07-04 Meeting
   * Next things to fix: Make recommendations grey, show classifier used for making each recommendation, fix duplicate recommendation issue(it was because of window offset)
   * after fixing these bugs we should further work on the customization settings of the recommendation module.

---++ 2017-06-28 Meeting
   * we fixed an error which made it impossible to click on recommended annotations
   * until next week: keep debugging. Inspect why we get recommendations that span multiple words (it was because the Annotation Id was not unique).
     
---++ 2017-06-13 Meeting
   * fixed inception startup issues
   * Debugging inception
   * Next steps: https://git.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/inception/webanno-inception/issues/1 

---++ 2017-06-06 Meeting
   * Next tasks:
      * get Layer from VID instead of !PredictionModel and adjust methods
      * !AnnotationObject: add field "feature"
      * when prediction are made by the classifier, the feature which is predicted must be hardcoded in the classifier where model is created

---++ 2017-05-30 Meeting
   * discussed further procedure of TD's integration
      * Used VDocument instead of !GetDocumentResponse
      * refactoring of other methods

---++ 2017-05-23 Meeting
   * discussed further procedure of TD's integration
   * I will propose changes by pushing into my clone of webanno-td

---++ 2017-05-16 Meeting
   * set up project correctly
   * continue working on last week's task
   * discussed how an extension could look like

---++ 2017-05-04 Meeting
   * Discuss timesheets
   * new Task:
      * Some components of TD's Webanno fork should be moved to the Inception project.
         * Perform Code Archeology on Webanno and compare the differences between the master project on TD's fork
         * point out differences where  may be extension points may be defined
        
---++ 2017-04-24 Meeting
   * clarified how #6 should be solved
      * The input stream must be read two times. There are still two tests who fail (those with DKPro header)
   * new tasks: 
      * finish #6
      * #7 modify !BinaryCasWriter:
         * Currently, the program accumulates the typesystem for every document that passes the pipeline. 
         * There should be a boolean parameter to turn this off. 
            * If the parameter is off, only the first typesystem should be merged.
               * this should happen in !typeSystemInit()
         * Make it possible to specify an external typesystem
         * Tests in !BinaryCasWriterReaderTest.java must be adjusted, s.t. tests will be carried out in both modes.
      
---++ 2017-04-18 Meeting
   * review of #5
   * next task:  #6 modify !BinaryCasReader to merge the typesystem of previous engine with typesystem of current engine
      
---++ 2017-04-10 Meeting
   * handed over contract and account credentials
   * Issues with tasks of last week:
      * #1 Set up project correctly and fixed(deleted) missing dependencies
      * #2 Tests didn't pass. Solution: Increase surefire heap size ( mvn clean install -Dmaven.surefire.heap=6g )
      * #3 Text Reader in Galaxy Tool Builder didn't accept only single files
   * Discussed further issues
      * #4 Make it possible to use the tools on a server without internet access
         * thus, a Docker file would need to be written to predownload all the dependencies
      * #5 Increase Usability
         * Change certain input fields to dropdown menus to exclude certain values
         * Remove certain input fields
         * This info can be passed into the xml files of each tool
      * #6 Make it possible to run the whole pipeline on a simple example e.g. data -> Text Reader -> Umlaut Normalizer -> Text Writer
   * New Tasks
     * Create PR for #3
      * work on #5 https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-meta/issues/5
   
---++ 2017-04-04 Meeting
   * New Tasks
      * DKPro Core auschecken und bauen
      * DKPro Meta auschecken und Galaxy Tool Builder laufen lassen
      * Konfigurationsdateien die von !GalaxyToolBuilder erzeugt wurden mit Galaxy/Docker laufen lassen
      * Lesen:
         * Galaxy Tool Files
         * Code von !GalaxyToolBuilder
         * Output von: !GalaxyToolBuilder
