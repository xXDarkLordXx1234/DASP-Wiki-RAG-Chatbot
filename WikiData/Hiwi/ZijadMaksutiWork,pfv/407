| Uby-LMF | 30 November 2011 | 4.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. |
| Uby-LMF | 1 Dezember 2011 | 5.5 | Uby-Meeting. Consulation with REC about using extJWNL in WNConverter. Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. |
| Uby-LMF | 3 Dezember 2011 | 5.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1360][bug 1360]]. |
| Uby-LMF | 4 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1360][bug 1360]]. |
| Uby-LMF | 6 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. Looking for best way to separate definitions from example sentences in WordNet's glosses. |
| Uby-LMF | 7 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. Consulation with JEK. Consultation with REC. |
| Uby-LMF | 8 Dezember 2011 | 7.0 | Uby-Meeting. Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. |
| !WNConverter, Populating uby_release_1.0 | 11 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Implemented a mechanism for partitioning WordNet's glosses [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1380][(bug 1380)]]. MWEs are still a problem when searching for a corresponding example sentence. This will be handled with the UIMA-Pipeline in the near future <br /> I was not able to populate uby_release_1.0 with WikiDe-LMF: Strange exceptions, I will talk with MiM about this. |
| Uby-LMF | 12 Dezember 2011 | 1.5 | Getting familiar with UIMA, in order to program a pipeline for !WNConverter. |
| Uby-LMF | 13 Dezember 2011 | 1.5 | Consultation with !MiM. Getting familiar with UIMA, in order to program a pipeline for !WNConverter. |
| Uby-LMF | 14 Dezember 2011 | 4 | Getting familiar with UIMA. Started implementing the pipeline. |
| Uby-LMF | 27 Dezember 2011 | 10 | Pipeline implemented (Reader, Tokenizer, Lemmatizer, Writer). Started integrating the pipeline into !WNConverter. The pipeline does not always help when searching for a corresponding example sentence (for a lexeme in a synset). Some of the correspondences have to be entered manually. Therefore i have also started to implement an XML-based parser which parses manually entered correspondences. The file containing the correspondences will automatically be filled with entries that need human attention. |
| Uby-LMF | 28 Dezember 2011 | 10 | Pipeline is integrated into !WNConverter. Completed implementing the parser for manually entered correspondences.  Implemented JUnit testcase for checking if all example sentences are present in the xml generated by the !WNConverter. The conversion is running. |
| Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 03 Januar 2012 | 8 | Redisigning the usage of the pipeline, because it drastically slowed the converter down and the number of  unsuccessfully processed synsets was to high (over 300 for nouns only). The converter is run again. Looking for a way to extract "sense_numbers" from WordNet's files in order to map them to _index_ attribute of _Sense class_. |
| Meeting; Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 05 Januar 2011 | 8 | Uby-Meeting. New wnInLMF.xml (with extracted example sentences) is imported to uby_wordnet_05_01_2012. WNInLMF.xml is valid against our latest DTD. Consultation with REC about the slow pipeline; Implementation (!WNConverter is much faster now). Started to program parser for Wordnet's index.sense file in order to extract "sense_numbers". Neither JWNL nor extJWNL parses this file, we have to do it ourselves. |
| Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 11 Januar 2012 | 5 | Documenting WNConverter. Parser for "index.sense" file is integrated in !WNConverter. Index attribute of Sense class is now properly set. All Senses of a LexicalEntry now have different indexes (this is checked automatically during the conversion). There are exactly eight (out of more than 200000) Senses for which no entry in index.sense file exists (error in WordNet's data). Index attributes of affected Senses will incrementally be filled with dummy values (as proposed by JEK). !WNConverter now uses only extJWNL for accessing the files (removed dependencies to old JWNL). |
| Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 12 Januar 2012 | 4 | Documenting WNConverter. !WNConverter now assigns dummy-values to index attribute of Senses for which no sense number in "index.sense" is found. Running !WNConverter, importing newest xml to Database. |
| Uby-LMF | 19 Januar 2012 | 0.5 | Meeting. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 20 Januar 2012 | 7.5 | Uploaded the newest version of DTD, removed the old ones from SVN. Looking at Coding-Practices used by DKPro. Cleaning the Code of FNConverter: adding fair Java-Docs, links, and descriptions. Replacing _System.out.println()_ with a Logger (this is also the practice at DKPro). |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 22 Januar 2012 | 9.5 | !FNConverter is cleaned and ready for release. Only thing remaining to be done is adding class-headers, which will be done after we agree under which license the converter will be published. |
| Uby-Meeting | 26 Januar 2012 | 1.0 | Meeting. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 27 Januar 2012 | 8.0 | Fixed bugs in !FNConverter reported by JEK and SH regarding attributes of Sense class and !SemanticLabel  class. <br /> Started writing [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wiki/bin/view/LSR/UbyConversionTutorial][UbyConversionTutorial]]. <br /> Moving the modified FN-API from it's old Folder in SVN caused build-failures on Jenkins (auto-build-system used at UKP), which I was not aware of until today. It took me some time to reconfigure Jenkins in order to get rid of the error messages. !FNConverter now uses the new Snapshot of modified FN-API, because we need to clean it before the release. <br /> Started cleaning !GNConverter. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 28 Januar 2012 | 7.0 | Cleaning  !GNConverter and adding Javadoc (50% done). <br /> !GNConverter now uses class-loader when parsing !SubcatMapping-file: this prevents "file not found"-errors when using the converter on non-Unix systems. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 29 Januar 2012 | 7.0 | !GNConverter is documented and cleaned. Fixed the bug reported by JEK regarding value of exampleType attribute of !SenseExample class.  Found a bug in Model and fixed it (equals()-method in Synset class caused duplicate Synsets in xml produced by GNConverter). Added a section for using !GNConverter in [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wiki/bin/view/LSR/UbyConversionTutorial][UbyConversionTutorial]] |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 30 Januar 2012 | 4.5 | Checking the correctness of  !GNConverter after the cleanup: No errors determined. The number of generated instances of Synset, !LexicalEntry and Senses remains equal to number of instances generated by previous versions of the !GNConverter. Removing unused files from SVN (old subcat-mapping files). Updating other modules that use !GNConverter. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 10 Februar 2012 | 8.0 | Cleaning !WNConverter. Optimizing and adding Javadoc. (50% done) |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 12 Februar 2012 | 8.0 | Cleaning !WNConverter. Optimizing and adding Javadoc. (75% done). Slow progress due to the size and the complexity of the converter. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 14 Februar 2012 | 8.0 | !WNConverter is optimized and cleaned. <br /> !WNConverter now uses class-loader when parsing !SubcatMapping-file and the file with manually entered mappings of example sentences: this prevents "file not found"-errors when using the converter on non-Unix systems. <br/> Checking the correctness of  !WNConverter after the cleanup: Some !SubcategorizationFrame-instances are missing -> I am working on it. <br/> Added a section for using !WNConverter in [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wiki/bin/view/LSR/UbyConversionTutorial][UbyConversionTutorial]] |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code); Meeting | 16 Februar 2012 | 4.0 | Uby_Meeting <br/> !WNConverter now generates all !SubcategorizationFrame-instances. Generated xml will is valid against DTD_15_2. <br/> JEK asked me to check the creation of !SubcategorizationFrames in !GNConverter as well: Done; No errors determined. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 27 Februar 2012 | 2.0 | Starting adding Headers to modules that will be published under Apache-License. |
| !WNConverter (final changes) | 16 März  2012 | 8.0 | Removed unused files (dtds, hibernate-mappings). <br /> Changed the WNConverter so that the files used by it (frame mappings), can be accessed even if the WNCoverter is embedded in a jar: the user must not checkout the whole project in order to use the converter, the converter can be referenced as a dependence in a foreign project and everything needed comes packed in a jar. <br /> Added license-headers to all files of the converter. <br /> Added License.txt <br /> [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wiki/bin/view/LSR/UbyConversionTutorial][UbyConversionTutorial]] is updated. <br /> integration.tools is updated. <br /> Converter is tested two times, everything worked fine. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 19 März 2012 | 8.5 | !VNConverter: Added license-headers. <br/> !OWConverter: Added license-headers. <br/> !WKTConverter: Added license headers. The converter now handles comments in resource-files (needed because of the added headers). <br/> !WPConverter: Added license headers. <br/> !GNConverter: Added license headers. The converter now handles comments in resource-files (needed because of the added headers). The converter now uses streams to acces subcatMapping-file. A user does not have to specify the path to the file, it is loaded automatically (works even when the converter is embedded in a jar). <br/> !FNConvertert: Added license-headers. <br/> [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wiki/bin/view/LSR/UbyConversionTutorial][UbyConversionTutorial]] is updated.  |
| Improving WKTConverter | 21 März 2012 | 6.0 | !WKTConverter now uses !ClassLoader and streams to read its resource-files. This simplifies the usage of the converter, because the user does not have to specify the path of each file. Old methods are left preserved, for the case when the user wants to load his custom resource-files. !ConversionExample is updated. Removed unneeded files from _tools_ package. [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wiki/bin/view/LSR/UbyConversionTutorial][UbyConversionTutorial]] is updated. |
| Uby-Meeting. Meeting with REC. | 22 März 2012 | 1.5 | Uby-Meeting. Meeting with REC about publishing uby on google-code. |
| Moving to google-code. | 24 März 2012 | 11.0 | Consultation with REC. Uby is splitted into two parts: "non-free" and "free". "free" part is published on google-code. Modules of both parts are configured and labeled appropriately. |
| Moving to google-code. | 25 März 2012 | 0.5 | Auto-Build (Jenkins) for both "free" and "non-free" Uby is now configured. |
| Moving to google-code. | 26 März 2012 | 8.5 | Consultation with JEK and !MiM. Simplified and updated !WNConverter-section of [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/wiki/bin/view/LSR/UbyConversionTutorial][UbyConversionTutorial]]. Moved 5 Uby-Modules from "non-free" to "free"-Repository on !GoogleCode. The modules are reconfigured appropriately. |
| Moving to google-code. | 27 März 2012 | 7.0 | Remaining modules of Uby are moved from "non-free" to "free"-Repository on !GoogleCode. Everything is on its place now, the modules are reconfigured. OW-API, written by !MiM, is also moved to public repository on !GoogleCode (License-Headers are added, dependences on Ubys modules are adjusted). Done last checks on rewritten !FrameNet-API, before publishing it over Zoidberg.  |
| Releasing Uby | 28 März 2012 | 13.0 | Now, a user can checkout the whole (free) Uby without dependence issues. Various jars are uploaded to zoidberg in order to make this possible. We have to make another release of modified JFN-Api  and omegawikiapi, in order to make Uby SNAPSHOT-Free. All other SNAPSHOT-dependences are replaced with releases. I had to ban !TreeTagger from WNConverter, because of licensing issues. !WNConverter now uses !StanfordLemmatizer instead (tested, it works). Because of dependence to a stanford-module, !WNConverter will be published under GPL (reconfigured appropriately).  |
| Releasing Uby | 29 März 2012 | 4.0 | Made relases of JFN-API and OW-API. Uby is reconfigured and SNAPSHOT-free.  |
| Optimizing Uby | 10 April 2012 | 4.5 | Meeting with TD about optimizing Uby-API (parts involving database-access). <br> Setting profiling environment  in order to identify slow methods. |

The problem should be fixed now (waiting for TDs feedback). Other modules depending on lmf.api-module are thoroughly tested to make sure that the fix did not introduce problems on other parts of UBY-API (modified parts of code are essential in UBY). |
| Uby-Meeting | 3 Mai 2012 | 1.0 | Meeting. |
| Release 0.1.1 | 09 Mai 2012 | 8.0 | UBY 0.1.1 (Java code) released. The new release contains changes which simplify the usage of Uby and improve stability. Tutorials, examples and downloads on !GoogleCode are updated accordingly. | 
| Fixing Bugs. | 11 Mai 2012 | 4.5 | REC changed _settings.xml_ used by non-ukp members to access code-releases over maven: Updated tutorials on !GoogleCode for Uby and !OmegaWiki-API. <br> Standardizing methods in Uby: TM reported an issue in Bugzilla. Return-value of Ubys methods is not unified when there is nothing to return. Some methods return null, some return an empty list. The goal is to return null (for simple data types) or an empty collection (for collections). Testing if this change would introduce problems when writing Uby to database and vice versa. |
| Standardizing methods in Uby | 12 Mai 2012 | 4.5 | Standardizing return values of methods in Definition, !GlobalInformation and !LexicalEntry classes. Also adding fair class descriptions using http://www.tagmatica.fr/lmf/iso_tc37_sc4_n453_rev16_FDIS_24613_LMF.pdf and http://www.isocat.org/ |

Added more user friendly constructor for !SemanticLabel class. <br> TD reported a problem with Uby-API. The problem is that hibernate cannot find getters for some attributes of Uby-Classes. Specifying the field-access in hibernate mappings solves the problem. Started adapting the mappings.  |
| Fixing hibernate mappings | 04 Juli 2012 | 3.5 | All mappings are adapted (see above). Thoroughly tested both reading from and writing to database: no errors determined.  |
| Uby-Meeting <br> Standardizing methods in Uby | 05 Juli 2012 | 4.0 |Uby-Meeting.<br> <br> As discussed with JEK, the following is done: <br> *In model module* Added comments to !ESyntacticPropert, !EVerbForm and !EVerbFormMood.

| Cleaning UBY-API and adding !JavaDoc | 07 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | Cleaning and commenting of classes Uby.java and !UbyStatistics.java. The behaviour of some methods had to be tested before commenting because of their complexity. The classes of API package need extra care because they are the first thing that the community sees when using Uby. |
| Cleaning UBY-API and adding !JavaDoc | 11 Juli 2012 | 5.0 | Cleaning and commenting of Uby.java. The behaviour of some methods had to be tested before commenting because of their complexity. Updated nonfree modules to latest changes in the API. |
| UBY-Meeting <p> Fixing a bug <p> Cleaning UBY-API and adding !JavaDoc | 12 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | Regular UBY-Meeting <p> TD reported a bug in the model when returning boolean values which are set to null in the UBY-database. The bug caused unexpected exceptions. The bug is fixed, affected methods are tested, TD is informed. <p> Cleaning and commenting of Uby.java. |
| Fixing a bug <p> Cleaning UBY-API and adding !JavaDoc | 15 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | Cleaning and commenting of Uby.java. <p> Found a bug in method getWNSensebyExtRef(String, String). The method did not work at all and threw !ClassCastException every time when invoked. Fixed this. |
| Cleaning UBY-API and adding !JavaDoc | 16 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | Cleaning and commenting of Uby.java and !UbyQuickAPI.java. <p> Updated all nonfree modules to changes mentioned above. |
| Cleaning UBY-API and adding !JavaDoc | 17 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | The public api-asl module of  UBY is now cleaned and commented. The !UbyQuickAPI.java is now an extension of Uby.java which offers additional methods for fast fetching of the UBY-LMF class instances. The distribution of methods is adapted accordingly. This increases usability and also relieves the overloaded Uby.java class. |
| Meeting with TD <p> Fixing a bug <p> Preparing new UBY release  | 18 Juli 2012 | 5.0 | Meeting with TD about further development of api-asl module. Making design decisions regarding Java code. <p> A user reported two broken methods on !GoogleCode. The methods are used for obtaining senses extracted from !WordNet. The bug is fixed. <p> Cleaned all modules from deprecated methods. This is a preparation for the new UBY release planed for september.  |
| Integrating !GermaNet 7.0 into UBY  | 19 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | Started adapting the !GNConverter to new version of !GermaNet. The converter now produces a UBY-LMF structure valid to ubyLmfDTD_1_0.dtd without errors. However, almost half of available information is missing. |
| Integrating !GermaNet 7.0 into UBY  | 22 Juli 2012 | 5.0 | Adapting the !GNConverter to new version of !GermaNet. Writing test cases for modified methods in parallel: this will pay off in the future. |
| Integrating !GermaNet 7.0 into UBY  | 28 Juli 2012 | 7.5 | Adapting the !GNConverter to new version of !GermaNet and adding tests. <p> lmfxml-asl has bugs causing incomplete generation of xml for a given UBY-LMF resource. Started fixing and adding tests. |
| Integrating !GermaNet 7.0 into UBY  | 29 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | lmfxml-asl has bugs causing incomplete generation of xml for a given UBY-LMF resource. Fixing and adding tests. <p> Added convenient methods in !LexicalResource, Lexicon and !LexicalEntry classes with basic test cases.  Added enumerator !EDegree to model (it was missing). Added degree attribute to !WordForm class (it was missing). <p> Updated hibernate mappings to latest changes in the model. |
| Fixing lmfxml-asl module | 30 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | The  lmfxml-asl has bugs causing incomplete generation of xml for a given UBY-LMF resource. Fixing and adding tests. <p> Added convenient constructors in !Sense, Synset and !SemanticArgument classes with basic test cases.  <p> Systematic testing of !LMFXmlWriter revealed another cause of incomplete XML-Generation: the !LMFXmlWriter cannot find getters with names that are not canonical. A simple solution with field access using annotations will be introduced. We had a similar bug involving database access. |
| Meeting with JEK. <p> Fixing lmfxml-asl module | 31 Juli 2012 | 4.0 | Meeting with JEK. <p> Introduced new annotation in the model. The annotation specifies the art of accessing field values of various UBY-LMF classes. This will help to fix the bug in lmfxml-asl  that causes incomplete XML-files. Added tests for the rest of UBY-LMF structure. |
| Fixing lmfxml-asl module | 1 August 2012 | 4.0 | Adding test cases in order to check if all UBY-LMF classes are correctly written to XML-file. |
| Fixing lmfxml-asl module | 4 August 2012 | 4.0 | Adding test cases in order to check if all UBY-LMF classes are correctly written to XML-file. The !LMFXmlWriter now also writes values of inherited class fields to xml. <p> Added annotations to !SemanticRelation class.|
| Fixing lmfxml-asl module | 5 August 2012 | 4.0 | Adding test cases in order to check if all UBY-LMF classes are correctly written to XML-file, the whole UBY-LMF structure must be covered. <p> Added annotations to Component and !SyntacticArgument class.  |
| Fixing lmfxml-asl module | 15 August 2012 | 4.0 | Adding test cases in order to check if all UBY-LMF classes are correctly written to XML-file.<p> Added annotations to !SemanticArgument and !SyntacticPredicate class.  |
| UBY-Meeting <p> Fixing lmfxml-asl module | 16 August 2012 | 3.0 | UBY Meeting. <p> Adding test cases in order to check if all UBY-LMF classes are correctly written to XML-file.  |
| Modifying model <p> Converting UBY to RDF | 17 August 2012 | 5.5 | Adapting model-asl to latest changes in UBY-LMF DTD. <p>  In order to start converting UBY to RDF, first we need to create an XML from the entire UBY database. Trying to do this resulted in numerous errors involving retrieval of lexicons and sense-axes. The problem was that some lexicons and sense-axes had their indices in the database set to NULL. I do not know how this happened, however I managed to fix the problem by rebuilding the indices in the database. I also added few lines of code in the postprocessing tutorial on google code, so that users do not face the same errors. Converting the whole UBY to XML is a bit challenging because of the RAM limitations. I am working on it. |
| Converting UBY to RDF | 18 August 2012 | 2 | Trying to convert UBY to XML. Optimizing conversion process. |
| Converting UBY to RDF | 20 August 2012 | 4 | Setting up a development environment on one of the pool-computers.<p>Preparing the database for the conversion. |
