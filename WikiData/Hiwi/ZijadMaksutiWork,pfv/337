| Uby-LMF | 1 Dezember 2011 | 5.5 | Uby-Meeting. Consulation with REC about using extJWNL in WNConverter. Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. |
| Uby-LMF | 3 Dezember 2011 | 5.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1360][bug 1360]]. |
| Uby-LMF | 4 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1360][bug 1360]]. |
| Uby-LMF | 6 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. Looking for best way to separate definitions from example sentences in WordNet's glosses. |
| Uby-LMF | 7 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. Consulation with JEK. Consultation with REC. |
| Uby-LMF | 8 Dezember 2011 | 7.0 | Uby-Meeting. Working on [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1325][bug 1325]]. |
| !WNConverter, Populating uby_release_1.0 | 11 Dezember 2011 | 4.0 | Implemented a mechanism for partitioning WordNet's glosses [[https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1380][(bug 1380)]]. MWEs are still a problem when searching for a corresponding example sentence. This will be handled with the UIMA-Pipeline in the near future <br /> I was not able to populate uby_release_1.0 with WikiDe-LMF: Strange exceptions, I will talk with MiM about this. |
| Uby-LMF | 12 Dezember 2011 | 1.5 | Getting familiar with UIMA, in order to program a pipeline for !WNConverter. |
| Uby-LMF | 13 Dezember 2011 | 1.5 | Consultation with !MiM. Getting familiar with UIMA, in order to program a pipeline for !WNConverter. |
| Uby-LMF | 14 Dezember 2011 | 4 | Getting familiar with UIMA. Started implementing the pipeline. |
| Uby-LMF | 27 Dezember 2011 | 10 | Pipeline implemented (Reader, Tokenizer, Lemmatizer, Writer). Started integrating the pipeline into !WNConverter. The pipeline does not always help when searching for a corresponding example sentence (for a lexeme in a synset). Some of the correspondences have to be entered manually. Therefore i have also started to implement an XML-based parser which parses manually entered correspondences. The file containing the correspondences will automatically be filled with entries that need human attention. |
| Uby-LMF | 28 Dezember 2011 | 10 | Pipeline is integrated into !WNConverter. Completed implementing the parser for manually entered correspondences.  Implemented JUnit testcase for checking if all example sentences are present in the xml generated by the !WNConverter. The conversion is running. |
| Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 03 Januar 2012 | 8 | Redisigning the usage of the pipeline, because it drastically slowed the converter down and the number of  unsuccessfully processed synsets was to high (over 300 for nouns only). The converter is run again. Looking for a way to extract "sense_numbers" from WordNet's files in order to map them to _index_ attribute of _Sense class_. |
| Meeting; Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 05 Januar 2011 | 8 | Uby-Meeting. New wnInLMF.xml (with extracted example sentences) is imported to uby_wordnet_05_01_2012. WNInLMF.xml is valid against our latest DTD. Consultation with REC about the slow pipeline; Implementation (!WNConverter is much faster now). Started to program parser for Wordnet's index.sense file in order to extract "sense_numbers". Neither JWNL nor extJWNL parses this file, we have to do it ourselves. |
| Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 11 Januar 2012 | 5 | Documenting WNConverter. Parser for "index.sense" file is integrated in !WNConverter. Index attribute of Sense class is now properly set. All Senses of a LexicalEntry now have different indexes (this is checked automatically during the conversion). There are exactly eight (out of more than 200000) Senses for which no entry in index.sense file exists (error in WordNet's data). Index attributes of affected Senses will incrementally be filled with dummy values (as proposed by JEK). !WNConverter now uses only extJWNL for accessing the files (removed dependencies to old JWNL). |
| Uby-LMF (polishing !WNConverter) | 12 Januar 2012 | 4 | Documenting WNConverter. !WNConverter now assigns dummy-values to index attribute of Senses for which no sense number in "index.sense" is found. Running !WNConverter, importing newest xml to Database. |
| Uby-LMF | 19 Januar 2012 | 0.5 | Meeting. |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 20 Januar 2012 | 7.5 | Uploaded the newest version of DTD, removed the old ones from SVN. Looking at Coding-Practices used by DKPro. Cleaning the Code of FNConverter: adding fair Java-Docs, links, and descriptions. Replacing _System.out.println()_ with a Logger (this is also the practice at DKPro). |
| Uby-LMF (cleaning up the code) | 22 Januar 2012 | 9.5 | !FNConverter is cleaned and ready for release. Only thing remaining to be done is adding class-headers, which will be done after we agree under which license the converter will be published. |
