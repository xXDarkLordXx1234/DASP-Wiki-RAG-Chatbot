---+++Pedocs Corpus Format

The *original* Pedocs corpus contains the following two parts:
   * The corpus documents as PDF files, compressed. (=pedocs-volltexte.tar.gz=)
      * Each PDF is stored in the subfolder =&lt;year&gt;/&lt;document_opus_id&gt;/pdf/&lt;title_or_something&gt;.pdf=.<br />For example, =2010/2092/pdf/Weiner_Wissensmanagement_im_Unterricht_berufsbildender_Schulen_D_A.pdf= .
   * The metadata (including the gold keyphrases and the ID - "opus ID") as SQL dump, compressed. (=pedocs-sql.tar.gz=)

The *processed* corpus is in the following format:
   * All files are stored flatly in one single folder.
   * For each document, three files are present:
      * =&lt;document_opus_id&gt;.txt= : The extracted text from the PDF file, in plain text format.
      * =&lt;document_opus_id&gt;.keys= : The gold keyphrases in plain text format, one line for each keyphrase, trimmed (the last line could be empty). 
      * =&lt;document_opus_id&gt;.keys.lemmatized= : The lemmatized gold keyphrases in plain text format, one line for each keyphrase, trimmed (the last line could be empty).
   * In order to keep the archive size small, the original PDF file is not included.
   * Only German documents are retained. Documents of other languages are ignored.
