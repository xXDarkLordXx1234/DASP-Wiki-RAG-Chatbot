---+ Spring Web Services learning note

---++ Style
   * Contract-First: Try and think in XML. Java is _implementation detail_.

---++ Features
   * Facilitates contract-first SOAP service development
   * Easier to have loose coupling between contract and implementation
   * Flexible XML Marshalling, also usable in non-Web service code
   * Architecture similar to Spring-MVC
   * Security: WS-Security, Acegi, Spring Security...
   * Built by Maven, Apache license



---++ Building contract
---+++ Generating XSD from XML
   * With trang, downloadable from http://www.thaiopensource.com/download/
   * Tutorial http://www.dotkam.com/2008/05/28/generate-xsd-from-xml/

---++ Creating Endpoint
   * Two flavors:
      * Message endpoint: SOAP header + SOAP body
      * Payload endpoint: only SOAP body


---++ XML Marshalling / Unmarshalling
Convert XML document from and to object

---+++ With JAXB
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/index-140168.html

---+++ Advantages
   * Simplifies access to XML doc
   * No need to know XML processing. Less code.
   * Access data in non-sequential order without navigating through a tree.
   * More efficient memory usage than DOM
   * Flexible input, output, validate and binding behavior options

---+++ Unmarshalling: XML -> obj
   * Access XML resource (=InputStream=, URL, DOM, transformed XML data - like =SAXResult= ...) via Java object, implicit parsing.
   * Steps:
      1. Generate .jaxb from .xsd ("Bind the schema")
      1. Use JAXB newInstance(.jaxb) (context created), unmarshal(.xml)
      1. Access resulting java object, obtained from .xml
   * Can also validate a XML file
   * Spec-wise does not have to stop when faces invalid doc:
      * It is possible for a JAXB implementation to successfully unmarshal an invalid XML document, and build a Java content tree. However, the result won't be valid.
   
---+++ Marshalling: obj -> XML
   * Create XML resource like creating java objects, and store to XML file, OutputStream, DOM, transformed XML data - like =SAXResult= ... .
   * Marshall to transformed XML data in order to, for example, process the data as SAX events.
   * Steps:
      1. Bind the schema
      1. Create content tree with generated =ObjectFactory= which has =createXXX()= according to the XML tree structure
      1. Set properties to the created objects
      1. Use JAXB newInstance(.jaxb) (context created), marshall(rootObj, FileOutputStream(.xml))
   * Validation is a separate operation. To validate, get =Validator= from jaxb context, and validate(rootObj)

---+++ Customizing binding
   * Binding can also be customized
   * In order to achieve this, annotate the schema file with binding declarations. It will override or extend the default binding behavior. JAXB allows these declarations to be made inline, or in a separate document.
   * More refer to URL above


---+++ Further reading
   * Spring in Action book
