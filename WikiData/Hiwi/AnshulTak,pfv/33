         * We will follow the second procedure (Building an Ant-based package and running it on a compute server (Maven)) described ([[DKPro.HowToRunExperimentsOnComputeServer][here]])
         * Best practice: Copy each *local* referenced project into your project (e.g. "DL"). 
         * Try: "mvn -Ppackage-deploy" from console
         * Maybe you need to clean things: "mvn -DskipTests=true clean install"

         * Adapt heap space in "/conf/wrapper.conf" of your deploy directory 12G
         * All parameters (paths (distant, train, test, result), growth rate, iterations, pool size, etc.) should be adaptable from args of main method

      * Commit self training project to SVN

---++ 2015-04-20
   * @info(CS): Evaluation of Self Training Experiment
      * Use de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.selftrainingcomponents.evaluation.Evaluateparameters in project selftraining components
      * Lines 40 and following have to be adapted according to the labels in the experiment ("P1" and "P2" instead of claim, etc.)
      * It collects all confusion matrices from each iteration of the ST-Experiment and outputs the F1-macro scores for each iteration
      * These scores should be put in a table (see [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/ResultTemplate.xlsx][template]]) tab "TT".
   * @action(CS): sign time records
      * Done
   * @action(CS): Please try if you have access to [[UKP.ServerJobs][this]] page.
      * This works :)
