---+ Meeting Minutes

---++ Next Meeting
   * @info(CS): Evaluation of Self Training Experiment
      * Use de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.selftrainingcomponents.evaluation.Evaluateparameters in project selftraining components
      * Lines 40 and following have to be adapted according to the labels in the experiment ("P1" and "P2" instead of claim, etc.)
      * It collects all confusion matrices from each iteration of the ST-Experiment and outputs the F1-macro scores for each iteration
      * These scores should be put in a table (see [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/ResultTemplate.xlsx][template]]) tab "TT".
   * @action(CS): sign time records
   * @action(CS): Please try if you have access to [[UKP.ServerJobs][this]] page.

---++ 2015-04-13
   * Form for weekly time schedule
   * SelfTraining Experiment (see below)


---++ 2015-03-30
   * @discuss(CS): Next steps in self training experiment
      * provided the data set of unlabeled data
   * @Discuss(CS): planed next annotation steps

---++ 2015-03-23
   * @discuss: Annotation of major claim... investigated results.
   * @discuss: solved issue with the annotation environment. 


---+ Results

---++ Current task (AT)
   * TODO: Include baseline results (train-test split) [DONE]
   * [AT]: Baseline [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/PC-selftraining_ConfusionMatrix_result.txt][results]]
   * TODO: Provide train-test split data 

   * Include Feature Extractors from PC into SelfTraining Experiment (done)
      * TODO: Test the experiment with a small number of unlabeled data and few iterations for ensuring it works as expected
      * If everything works, 
         * Commit the source into SVN
         * We will put the experiment on the server.
