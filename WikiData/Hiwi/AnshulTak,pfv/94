   * Try not to use only very-negative but also negative sentiments. Assumption is that we get more sentences..
   * Experiment with dependency parser to get minimal propositions
   * Please send me the files 


---++ 2016-02-15 at 11:00
   * Write a claim generation module from scratch:
      * *Retrieval and preprocessing*
         * 1) (manual) Use a search engine and search for a controversial _subject_ (e.g. "school uniform", "cloning" or "tourism")
            * (improve the queries by adding the supplement "pro con". You query will than look like "school uniform pro con")
            * (restrict your search engine to retrieve only english documents)
         * 2) (manual) Store the best n=20 resulting html files as text in one folder per query (keep the order and the urls in a separate file to ensure reproducability). The result is a folder including n html files and a txt-file including the urls and the order of the files
         * 3) (automatic) Remove the markup from html files using Apache Tika https://tika.apache.org/ (also available at maven central). the result should only include the pure text content. Store the results per query in another folder for each query.
         * 4) (automatic) Create DKPro-Pipeline to parse, extract sentences and preprocess the sentiment of the text files from step 3 (use (1) Language-Tool-Segmenter, (2) Stanford-Sentiment-Analyzer and (3) Stanford-Parser). Store the results for each query in another folder
         * *Results* of the retrieval process for each query are three folders:
            * (1) a folder includingthe html files including a description file (rank + urls of the html files),
            * (2) a folder including the cleaned txt files
            * (3) a folder including the preprocessed xmi-files
            * (do this procedure for at *least 5 different subjects*)
      * *Process Data*
         * 1) Create a script that extracts all sentences from the preprocessed XMIs that include the subject (e.g. "school uniforms", "cloning")
         * 2) Group the sentences in "Pro" and "Contra" according to the the sentiment score of the sentence (neutral sentences are discarded; maybe we should only focus on *very positive* and *very negative* sentences). Store these sentences in a document for each query. 
         * 3) Use dependencies to extract subject-predicate-object triples from the sentences. (the subject is your query, e.g. "school unigorms")
         * 4) maybe clustering, etc?
   * Technical setting:
      * Create a new Maven-Project: called "de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.claimsearch"
      * Package: de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.claimsearch
      * SVN: https://scruffy.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/dkpro/experiments/stab/misc/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.claimsearch/trunk

   * @discuss(CS): Current features in TC-Experiment
      * There are redundant ones (syntactic)? 
   * @todo(AT): Write a detailed description of the features

      * Include references with an appropriate style
      * Use scientific language!
      * Example: http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D14/D14-1006.pdf
      * Deadline: 25th November

---++ 2015-11-11
   * Next Task: Extend an existing python project to read the myside-bias data
      * The current project reads the data from an !tsv-file. (Note that in contrast to the my-side-bias data, the texts as well as the labels  are included in this tsv-file whereas the myside-bias-data texts are in additional text files)
      * Goal is to rund the three baselines using the myside bias data set instead of the current data set of the project
      * Some hints
         * In each baseline experiment (there are three), the data is read from the CV with the following command "data = pd.read_csv(path, header=0, delimiter="\t", quoting=3)". This data object is a dictionary including a list for each column of the tsv-file. This includes the texts and the labels. 
         * The data is then split in the data_splitting.py to generate randomly split folds (train, test, dev). Note that the cross validation in this setup is repeated several times (repeated cross-validation). 
         * For including the new data, you need to first create a list including all the texts (402 essays) and second get the labels for each essay by reading your tsv file. 
         * Having this, you can put both lists (text and labels) in a dictionary including the entities "ANNOTATION", "TEXT" and "ESSAY". Note that the order of the lists should match!! So an the first label in the label-list needs to be the the label of the first text in the text-list. 
         * Having this data structure, it should be relatively easy to adapt the current data_splitting.py file
         * I will send you the source code via email. 
         * *Deadline is 18th November*

---++ 2015-11-04
   * Checklist:
      * (Partially DONE ) Human Upper Bound (DONE @AT)
         * TODO: provide detailed results as discussed in one of the last emails
      * (DONE) Agreement Scores
      * (DONE) Class Distribution
      * (DONE) Baselines
   * Experiments:
      * Subjectivity and Structural features do not improve the predictions
      * Best current system: Lexical(lemma1-2) + sentiment + opinion + possitiveEffect + Syntactic (see Result_AllFeatures-V2.2.ods)
   * TODO until next week:
      * *TASK 1*: Remove local dependencies in pom
         * Don't use SNAPSHOT Versions of dkpro-TC use 0.7.0 instead (this is available at maven central)
         * Remove dependencies to local argumentation mining packages (there is also a release on maven central). Maybe you don't need this at all because we are not using any argument component types anymore! Remove it!
         * The paragraph annotator in needed for preprocessing. Copy it to the project in the preprocessing package.
         * Make sure to explicitly include the version number of the preprocessing engine in the pom.
         * I guess the only local reference will be the Stanford sentiment analyzer. Everything else should be at maven central.
         * Note: This step might require to remove several classes. those are not needed anymore :)
      * *TASK 2*: Repeat Experiments using the novel preprocessed data (4 h; preprocessing might take longer however this cannot count as working hours!)
         * Data needs to be processed using labels from annotations.csv and the source txt files
         * Current !PreprocessingPipeline.java does not include a reader which adds the label as discussed in our last session; It also uses a txt-file (goldoutcome.txt) instead of the final csv-file! 
         * !MySideBiasClassification.java still uses the old reader and NOT the new !DocumentBias-Type!
         * This needs to be fixed immediately! (*DEADLINE: Monday 9th November*)
         * Note: The preprocessing pipeline should only use the preprocessing engines which are needed for the experiment!
         * (Note that the data (csv-file and source documents) will be provided by CS)
         * *IMPORTANT: The nGram Feature Extractor Parameters might be redundant. This might cause serious problems!!!*
      * *TASK 3*: Best performing experiment? (1 h)
         * From the current code I'm not able to identify the best performing experiment (e.g. there are several syntactic feature extractors; the entry in Result_AllFeatures-V2.2.ods only states "syntactic features"; it's not clear which ones are used).
         * -> Provide an experiment with the best performing configuration. Remove ALL feature extractors, parameters, etc which are not required! 
      * *TASK 4*: Create tsv-file (tab-separated without quotes!) including the folds (3 h)
         * rows are the documents
         * columns are the 10 Folds showing which file is used as train and which as test
         * Hint: The id2outcome.txt in each TestTask-folder (there will be 10 for 10-fold CV in the result folder of an experiment) contain the essay names of the test set of a fold! 
         * Hint: each document is only one time used for testing
   



---++ 2015-10-28
   * @discuss(CS): tasks and results from last week
   * Next Steps:
      * *Inter-Annotator Agreement*
         * Use the CSV-file including the annotations from all annotators to determine the inter-annotator agreement among all three annotators on the 80 essays
         * Determine (1) Percentage Agreement, (2) Fleiss' Kappa, and (3) Krippendorff's Alpha
         * An example can be found in the following project: https://scruffy.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/dkpro/experiments/stab/misc/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.fallacies/trunk/0.0.3-SNAPSHOT
         * (the class is de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.fallacies.agreement.AgreementCSV)
         * Create a copy of this class in your project (myside-bias) and adapt it accordingly
      * *Human Upper Bound*
         * We will determine the human upper bound using the same evaluation measures (F1, Precision, Recall) as in our experiments. 
         * Task: Determine three confusion matrices (one for each annotator pair) from the CSV-file including the annotations of all annotators. 
         * Store all confusion matrices in the common DKpro-TC format. (confusionmatrix_A1_A2.csv)
         * Determine the human upper bound by determining the evaluation measures using confusionmatrix.java
         * Put the results in a table and determine the average values between all annotators. 
         * The result is the human performance and thus the upper bound for our experiments. 
   * Note, Please commit the source code and the resulting files in SVN (e.g. in src/main/resources/data; src/main/resources/agreement; src/main/resources/upperbound)
      * annotations.csv (including the annotation of all annotators on 80 essays)
      * goldstandard.csv (including the annotations of the entire data set 402 essays)
      * agreement.txt (including the output of the task above)
      * confusionmatrices_AX_AY.csv (the three confusion matrices for annotator pairs)
      * humanupperbound.docx (including the table with the human upper bound)

---++ 2015-10-21
   * time: 10:00 pm
   * Weekly Standup (What have you done; What will you do; What are any obstacles)
   * @info(CS): I'm not able to compile your code. There are errors in the repository!
      * ALWAYS make sure that the code in the repository is runnable.
   * Next steps:
      * *Make data reusable (AT:DONE)*
         * _Step1_: Create a table (!csv-file) including the annotations of our gold data (402 preprocessed cases). Each row needs to contain two entries (1) the essay ID and (2) the gold standard annotation. The annotation can be determined analogue to the approach in the current reader of the experiment (!MySideBiasEssayReader.java).
         * _Step2_: Create a !JavaClass which uses the raw txt files and the !csv-file from step1 to generate the preprocessed UIMA Cases (XMI). Note that it will be necessary to create a new type (document-level) for storing the label in the generated cases. (Input: Raw !txt-files, and !csv-file from step1) (see example in argumentation.type; copy "desc" and "METAInf" folders and adapt it; Include build code in POM; update project.)
         * _Step3_: Comment the code from and 2 since it will be published!
         * _Step4_: Write a brief but reusable !README.txt so that everyone will be able to follow the previous steps. Make sure that the !README.txt is understandable for everyone and perfectly written!
         * _Step5_: Adapt the previous reader so that it can read the created data. In particular, it needs to read the new type created in step 2 instead of extracting the outcome from the argumentation structures.
      * *Inter-Annotator Agreement*
         * _Step1_: Create a table (!csv-file) including the annotations from all three annotators (those are available for 80 files). Each row needs to contain (1) the essay ID and (2) the annotations of all three annotators. The annotations should be determined analogue to the process in the current reader of the experiment (!MySideBiasEssayReader.java). The annotations of the three annotators will be provided as preprocessed cases.
         * _Step2_: Write a !JavaClass to determine percentage, alpha, and kappa agreement scores based on the !csv-file created in step1.

   
---++ 2015-10-05
   * time: 2:00 pm
   * Weekly Standup (What have you done; What will you do; What are any obstacles)
      * @todo(AT): Please provide everything here for making the meeting more effective! 
      * Both feature description,Lemma(1-2),Implemented probability based features for opinion target (still need to finalize),List of all the features (Not done)
      * Finalize features,finish prob based feature, complete list of features with description, baseline??
   * @discuss(CS) two novel features
      * @todo(AT): provide description!
      * OpinionTarget (features): Basic idea: Attaching sense at word level in a document
      * Take an sentence as example "Apple is doing spectacular in its policies". Here 'spectacular' is showing author opinion toward the 'policies', so if one can attach a stance/opinion of an author to positive/negative then it can be shown if author has included opposite stance in the essay making it Non-Bias. 
      * Feature 1(Implemented): Number of positive/negative/neutral opinions 
      * Implementation: A sentence can be parsed using dependency parser into structure "amod(target,opinion),dobj(opinion,target),nsubj(opinion.target)". Now we have our subjectivity lexicon containing words with its polarity as positive/negative/neutral now this feature can be used to calculate count of positive/negative/neutral opinions.
      * Feature 2(Not-Implemented): Finding probability of individual target given it is positive/negative. P("policies|positive") P("policies|negative") can be extracted using finding number of times "policies" is used in positive sense or negative sense in the corpus. 
      * Implementation: Using meta-collector to calculated the top-N positive-negative opinions in the corpus and finding Probability as P("policies|positive") = # of times 'policies' is used as positive sense /# of time 'policies' is used in the corpus 
      * PositiveNegative Effect: Mostly it is same as Opinion-Target pair only difference is the lexicon used. Here lexicon show the effect by using verbs and categorising into positive or negative effect. For example "the children enjoyed diving" here 'diving' is having a + effect on complete sentence. 
      * Feature : Count number of positive/negative/neutral effect in the document as a feature. 
   * @discuss(CS) results w.r.t. lemma(1-2)
   * @discuss(CS): feature for feature ablation test
   * @info(CS): Could not find HTML-comparison! (@AT: Checked-in. I was not able to do it before cause of some error in SVN 500 error)
   * Code Quality:
      * Please ensure quality of the code
      * Use consistent indenting
      * Name classes with a Upper-case letter (!!!) (@AT: DONE)
      * Remove not required code before checking in (in particular if you copy paste a class)! 
      * -> TODO: Clean up the feature extractors.
   * Please update the code
      * You need package: de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.essays.utils (available in SVN in the misc folder)
      * CS: added a script for automatically generating results. This facilitates the experimentation
      * @todo(AT): Please include the HTML-Generation so that is automatically created after each experiment

---++ WIKI(mySideBias)
| *Details* |
Myside bias occurs when people evaluate evidence, generate evidence, and test hypotheses in a manner biased toward their own prior opinions and attitudes(1). 

*Feature idea: When a author try to put claims from his/her past experience than that essay is a strong contender for mySideBias* 
*Feature idea: claim:Premise ratio as mySideBias author will try to give less premise explaining against point instead if author explain his/her viewpoint so he will try to give more premise for claim [human psychology] *
*Feature idea: premise/claim length for both mySideBias and normal essay [need to check if this feature can work]*
*Feature idea: less use of negative connectors like but/although/nevertheless/still etc in mySideBias*
*Feature idea: Dubious nature in Major claim covering paragraph/conclusion paragraph which explains author point of view as will he give any against claim in it subsequent paragraph*

NOTE: Find some similarity in mySideBias essays also collect some of it and check their traits
