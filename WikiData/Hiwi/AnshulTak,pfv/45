      * Lines 40 and following have to be adapted according to the labels in the experiment ("P1" and "P2" instead of claim, etc.)
      * It collects all confusion matrices from each iteration of the ST-Experiment and outputs the F1-macro scores for each iteration
      * These scores should be put in a table (see [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/ResultTemplate.xlsx][template]]) tab "TT".

---++ WIKI(mySideBias)
| *Details* |
Myside bias occurs when people evaluate evidence, generate evidence, and test hypotheses in a manner biased toward their own prior opinions and attitudes(1). 

*Feature idea: When a author try to put claims from his/her past experience than that essay is a strong contender for mySideBias* 
*Feature idea: claim:Premise ratio as mySideBias author will try to give less premise explaining against point instead if author explain his/her viewpoint so he will try to give more premise for claim [human psychology] *
*Feature idea: premise/claim length for both mySideBias and normal essay [need to check if this feature can work]*
*Feature idea: less use of negative connectors like but/although/nevertheless/still etc in mySideBias*
*Feature idea: Dubious nature in Major claim covering paragraph/conclusion paragraph which explains author point of view as will he give any against claim in it subsequent paragraph*

NOTE: Find some similarity in mySideBias essays also collect some of it and check their traits
