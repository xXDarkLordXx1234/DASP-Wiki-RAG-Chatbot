---++ 2015-05-04
   * @discuss(CS): Self-Training experiment [AT]: DONE
      * Does it work after updating meta data in unlabeled data? (Yes; Done)
      * Commit to SVN (Done)
      * Share data sets (Done)
      * Running it on the server needs the following steps:
         * We will follow the second procedure (Building an Ant-based package and running it on a compute server (Maven)) described ([[DKPro.HowToRunExperimentsOnComputeServer][here]])
         * Best practice: Copy each *local* referenced project into your project (e.g. "DL"). 
         * Try: "mvn -Ppackage-deploy" from console
         * Maybe you need to clean things: "mvn -DskipTests=true clean install"
         * Test your project from the console by doing something like this: "bin/run -Dmainclass=package/of/the/MainClass -Dargline="arg1 arg2 ...""
         * Adapt heap space in "/conf/wrapper.conf" of your deploy directory 12G
         * All parameters (paths (distant, train, test, result), growth rate, iterations, pool size, etc.) should be adaptable from args of main method
   * @discuss(CS): Next steps of the annotation task 
      * Discuss annotation results
      * Next 40 essays
      * Relation classification
   * @info(CS): Guidelines are finished
   * *TODO*: [AT]: DONE
      * Run experiment on the whole data set (train-test split)... 5-10 iterations
      * Test the evaluation method (see below 2015-04-20)
      * Prepare project for running it on the server
      * Annotations 

---++ 2015-04-27
   * @info(AT): Analyzed issues in self training experiment
   * @info(CS): Please remember to fill out the time records for second and third week of april.
   * TODO: [AT]: DONE
      * Continue with annotation
      * Fix issue in LuceneBasedMetaColletors
         * Check if DocumentMetaData (in particular the title of the cas) is set in unlabeled data. Compare it to labeled data
      * Exchange data (train test split)
      * Commit self training project to SVN

---++ 2015-04-20
   * @info(CS): Evaluation of Self Training Experiment
      * Use de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.argumentation.selftrainingcomponents.evaluation.Evaluateparameters in project selftraining components
      * Lines 40 and following have to be adapted according to the labels in the experiment ("P1" and "P2" instead of claim, etc.)
      * It collects all confusion matrices from each iteration of the ST-Experiment and outputs the F1-macro scores for each iteration
      * These scores should be put in a table (see [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/ResultTemplate.xlsx][template]]) tab "TT".
   * @action(CS): sign time records
      * Done
   * @action(CS): Please try if you have access to [[UKP.ServerJobs][this]] page.
      * This works :)

---++ 2015-04-13
   * Form for weekly time schedule
   * SelfTraining Experiment (see below)


---++ 2015-03-30
   * @discuss(CS): Next steps in self training experiment
      * provided the data set of unlabeled data
   * @Discuss(CS): planed next annotation steps

---++ 2015-03-23
   * @discuss: Annotation of major claim... investigated results.
   * @discuss: solved issue with the annotation environment. 


---+ Results

---++ Current task (AT)
   * TODO: Include baseline results (train-test split) [DONE]
   * [AT]: Baseline [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/PC-selftraining_ConfusionMatrix_result.txt][results]]
   * TODO: Provide train-test split data 

   * Include Feature Extractors from PC into SelfTraining Experiment (done)
      * TODO: Test the experiment with a small number of unlabeled data and few iterations for ensuring it works as expected
      * If everything works, 
         * Commit the source into SVN
         * We will put the experiment on the server.
