---+++++ Thesis Overview

*"Improving Information Retrieval with Lexical Substitution"*
Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Chris Biemann, Dr. Jungi Kim

---++Meetings

---+++ 23.11.2012 (fifth meeting, just with Jungi)
   * Jungi presented his changes to me, he included "my" readers (which I had transformed from the old code) into one of his recent DKPro IR experiments
   * the pipelines are working now, including evaluation
   * Jungi said to not use DKPro Lab, because we don't have so many parameters

---+++ 22.11.2012 (fourth meeting, just with Jungi)
   * went through the code together, fixed many bugs
   * got the document indexing pipeline running
   * got stuck at the other pipeline (which does the topics and the search) by org.terrier source code
   * Richard (REC) dropped by, pointed us to DKPro Lab
   * EXTRA: read "A Lightweight Framework for Reproducible Parameter Sweeping in Information Retrieval", 2011


---+++ 08.11.2012 (third meeting, just with Jungi)
   * went through the framework and overall technical aspects with Jungi
   * set up SVN folder and shared with Jungi
   * %RED% TODO: %ENDCOLOR% rewrote dkrpro pipelines, readers and annotators (topics and docs) from the package into new uima layout (%RED%80% done%ENDCOLOR%)

---+++ 25.10.2012 (second meeting)
   * downloaded and installed the software/framework to use, 
   * %RED% TODO: %ENDCOLOR% manually evaluate the retrieval performance and examine "error classes"
   * %RED% TODO: %ENDCOLOR% read "Retrieving with good sense", 2000
   * EXTRA: read "Language model information retrieval with document expansion", 2006
   * EXTRA: read "Flexible UIMA Components for Information Retrieval Research", 2008


---+++ 11.10.2012 (first meeting)
   * I have read the following papers:
      * "CLEF 2009 Ad Hoc Track Overview: Robust-WSD Task", 2009
      * "Combining Probabilistic and Translation-Based Models for Information Retrieval Based on Word Sense Annotation", 2009
      * "Word Sense Disambiguation and Information Retrieval", 1994
      * "Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Information Retrieval", 2012
