---++ Richard Steuer<br /><br />Master Thesis Student November 2012 - April 2013.

---+++++ Thesis Overview

*"Improving Information Retrieval with Lexical Substitution"*
Supervisors: Prof. Dr. Chris Biemann, Dr. Jungi Kim

---++Meetings
   * (in) what we did within the meeting
   * (after) what I did after the meeting

---+++ 27.11.2012 (6th meeting, just with Jungi)
   * (in) sat down with Jungi to get help with the "cannot process topic" error; we thought it was an encoding error
   * (in) after spending one hour on it, we consulted Richard (REC) for another hour; he kindly took the time, ran the debugger and fixed the problem (solved by stopword removing round brackets and quotation marks)
   * (after) unpacked and indexed all the documents (that took several hours)

---+++ 23.11.2012 (5th meeting, just with Jungi)
   * (in) Jungi presented his changes to me: he included "my" readers (which I had transformed from the old code) into one of his recent DKPro IR experiments
   * (in) the pipelines are working now, including evaluation (see IrExperiments); he shared everything by SVN
   * (in) Jungi said to not use DKPro Lab, because we don't have so many parameters
   * (in) instead of the class _IndexTermGenerator_ we now use _IndexTermAnnotator_
   * %RED% TODO: %ENDCOLOR% understand and adapt new software package, keep it runnable

---+++ 22.11.2012 (4th meeting, just with Jungi)
   * (in) went through the code together, fixed many bugs
   * (in) got the document indexing pipeline running
   * (in) got stuck at the other pipeline (which does the topics and the search) by org.terrier source code
   * (in) Richard (REC) dropped by, pointed us to DKPro Lab
   * EXTRA: read "A Lightweight Framework for Reproducible Parameter Sweeping in Information Retrieval", 2011

---+++ 08.11.2012 (3rd meeting, just with Jungi)
   * (in) went through the framework and overall technical aspects with Jungi
   * (after) set up SVN folder and shared with Jungi
   * (after) rewrote dkrpro pipelines, readers and annotators (topics and docs) from the package into new uima layout

---+++ 25.10.2012 (2nd meeting)
   * (after) downloaded and installed the software/framework to use, 
   * %RED% TODO: %ENDCOLOR% manually evaluate the retrieval performance and examine "error classes"
   * %RED% TODO: %ENDCOLOR% read "Retrieving with good sense", 2000
   * EXTRA: read "Language model information retrieval with document expansion", 2006
   * EXTRA: read "Flexible UIMA Components for Information Retrieval Research", 2008


---+++ 11.10.2012 (1st meeting)
   * (after) I have read the following papers:
      * "CLEF 2009 Ad Hoc Track Overview: Robust-WSD Task", 2009
      * "Combining Probabilistic and Translation-Based Models for Information Retrieval Based on Word Sense Annotation", 2009
      * "Word Sense Disambiguation and Information Retrieval", 1994
      * "Word Sense Disambiguation Improves Information Retrieval", 2012
      * "Enriching Document Representation via Translation for Improved Monolingual Information Retrieval", 2011
      * "A Markov Random Field Model for Term Dependencies", 2005
      * "Latent concept expansion using markov random fields", 2007
