---+++ Verständnisfragen  
   * Unambiguous target: There is a page with the relation target's name in Wiktionary that contains only a single entry with a single sense. We assume that the relation's target is this single sense. Although this assumption holds for a large amount of relations, there are a few exceptions like  _ ?, where the correct Wiktionary entry or sense does not exist.
      * Wie ist das zu verstehen:  there are a few exceptions like  _ ?
    
   * Was ist POS? [erklärt, danke]
      * part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

---+++The _real_ notes and stuff
   * A tool for generating a definition graph.
      * Nodes are the senses of the definitons. Edges represent the relations.
         * The graph should be adapted for our needs, weighted edges can represent the similarity.
   * Finding the relations between definitions by using the graph in order to integrate them.
      * Problem: How can definitions be integrated?
         * Example: Definiton A and B overlap partially. Concatenating them would lead to redundant Information. Low-level text manipulation needed.
