---+++ Verständnisfragen  
   * Unambiguous target: There is a page with the relation target's name in Wiktionary that contains only a single entry with a single sense. We assume that the relation's target is this single sense. Although this assumption holds for a large amount of relations, there are a few exceptions like  _ ?, where the correct Wiktionary entry or sense does not exist.
      * Wie ist das zu verstehen:  there are a few exceptions like  _ ?
    
   * Was ist POS? [erklärt, danke]
      * part of speech, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.

---+++The _real_ notes and stuff
----+++++ Usage of sense graph
   * A tool for generating a definition graph.
      * Nodes are the senses of the definitons. Edges represent the relations.
         * The graph should be adapted for our needs, weighted edges can represent the similarity.
   * Finding the relations between definitions by using the graph in order to integrate them.
      * Problem: How can definitions be integrated?
         * Example: Definiton A and B overlap partially. Concatenating them would lead to redundant Information. Low-level text manipulation needed.
----+++++ Wiktionary vs. !WordNet
   * Wiktionary is more focused on word senses from natural sciences rather than social sciences or humanities, which are predominantly found in WordNet
   * !WordNet contains (on average) more word senses for verbs
   * Wiktionary has a higher number of maximum word senses for nouns.
   * WIktionary encodes additional word senses for seldomly used terms.
   * Wiktionary has better coverage of slang-related word senses.
