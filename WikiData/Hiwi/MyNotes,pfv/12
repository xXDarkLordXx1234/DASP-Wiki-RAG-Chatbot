---+++The _real_ notes and stuff
----+++++ Further steps: <br /> Representation of Recourses (!Wikipedia (WP), !Wiktionary (WKT), !OmegaWiki, !WordNet (WN), !FrameNet ) and relations between them in an UML-like diagram. <br /> Bottom-up phases:
   1 Get familiar with APIs used at UKP; starting with  !WordNet API JWNL
      * API cannot extract all informations provided by the recourses -> these informations should be marked in the diagram in order to know which parts of API should be developed later.
   2 Create separate diagram for every recourse
   3 Combine the diagrams and connect them with relations

----+++++ Usage of sense graph
   * A tool for generating a definition graph.
      * Nodes are the senses of the definitons. Edges represent the relations.
         * The graph should be adapted for our needs, weighted edges can represent the similarity.
   * Finding the relations between definitions by using the graph in order to integrate them.
      * Problem: How can definitions be integrated?
         * Example: Definiton A and B overlap partially. Concatenating them would lead to redundant Information. Low-level text manipulation needed.
----+++++ !WordNet
   * Contains only open word classes: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs
      * New forms constantly added
   * Does not contain closed word classes: determiners, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions and particles.
   * _Word class == POS_
----+++++ Wiktionary vs. !WordNet
   * Wiktionary is more focused on word senses from natural sciences rather than social sciences or humanities, which are predominantly found in WordNet
   * !WordNet contains (on average) more word senses for verbs
   * Wiktionary has a higher number of maximum word senses for nouns.
   * WIktionary encodes additional word senses for seldomly used terms.
   * Wiktionary has better coverage of slang-related word senses. <br />
   * Wordnet does not represent pronunciation, Wiktionary does.
----+++++ Jurafsky & Martin: Speech and Language Processing, Chapter 19 and 20
   * Lemma ist not necessarily the same as the stem from the morphological parse. Example: _celebrations -> celebrate (stem)_ and _celebrations -> celebration (lemma)_
   * *Polysemy* is when one word (term) has several meanings.
   * A practical technique for determining if two senses are distinct is to conjoin two uses of a word in a single sentence. This kind of conjunction of antagonistic readings is called *zeugma*.
   * *Homographs* are distinct senses linked to lemmas with the same orthographic form but different pronunciations.
