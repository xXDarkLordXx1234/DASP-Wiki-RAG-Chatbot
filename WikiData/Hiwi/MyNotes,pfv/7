---+++The _real_ notes and stuff
----+++++ Usage of sense graph
   * A tool for generating a definition graph.
      * Nodes are the senses of the definitons. Edges represent the relations.
         * The graph should be adapted for our needs, weighted edges can represent the similarity.
   * Finding the relations between definitions by using the graph in order to integrate them.
      * Problem: How can definitions be integrated?
         * Example: Definiton A and B overlap partially. Concatenating them would lead to redundant Information. Low-level text manipulation needed.
----+++++ Wiktionary vs. !WordNet
   * Wiktionary is more focused on word senses from natural sciences rather than social sciences or humanities, which are predominantly found in WordNet
   * !WordNet contains (on average) more word senses for verbs
   * Wiktionary has a higher number of maximum word senses for nouns.
   * WIktionary encodes additional word senses for seldomly used terms.
   * Wiktionary has better coverage of slang-related word senses. <br />
----+++++ Jurafsky & Martin: Speech and Language Processing, Chapter 19 and 20
   * Lemma ist not necessarily the same as the stem from the morphological parse. Example: _celebrations -> celebrate (stem)_ and _celebrations -> celebration (lemma)_
   * When two senses are connected semantically, the relation between them is called *polysemy*
   * A practical technique for determining if two senses are distinct is to conjoin two uses of a word in a single sentence. This kind of conjunction of antagonistic readings is called *zeugma*.
   * *Homographs* are distinct senses linked to lemmas with the same orthographic form but different pronunciations.
