---+!! TODO

---+++ Until 08.02

   * spring bean fix in the datatable provider (REC)
   
   * recommendation table does not have any content despite recommendations being in database (AZ)
   
   * describe how the preference learning currently works (AZ)
      * currently a TfIdf Recommender is in place for generating recommendations
      * uses MoreLikeThis feature from Solr

   * advanced techniques require manual effort
      * manually export the user preference data (button in the web application) 
      * call the python preference learning code to train a user preference model
         *  https://git.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/simpson/personalised_argumentation/blob/master/python/models/gp_pref_learning.py
      * import back top recommendations (currently not implemented)
 
   * describe how the preference learning should work (AZ)
      * above steps should be implemented in the reader
      * requires modules, that can do following tasks automatically (on schedule)
         *   retrieve preference data
         *   learn a preference model
         *   store recommendations in the database
         *   show user top recommendations (retrieved from database)

   
---+++ Further tasks
   
   * optimize feature extraction (REC)

   * change the code to make the preference extraction work as it should
      * preferences generated by user input (click on document /  add to library) 
      * currently: extracting preferences per query page
      * should: get document preferences globally

   * interleaving of recommenders in recommendation interface
   
   * discussion and execution of new task queries (only after first task is completed)
