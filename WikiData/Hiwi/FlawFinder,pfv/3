---++ Current deadlines

COLING Deadline August 25

---++ TODO
   * *Implement support for WEKA*
      * Maybe the following issues will be obsolete once we use Weka.
   * Fix (mallet-)support for libsvm and liblinear
   * In a crossfold validation setting, feature extraction should only be performed once.
   * Output/Input folder during Training/Classification should be fixed (-> location of train-data.mallet)
   * Lexical features do not have a name. (new Feature() does not assign a key - just a value)
   * Close writers in a finally-block.
   * Pipeline does not work with Java7

---++ Done
   * Weka support (=> tested with NaiveBayes and a small article set, test some more)
   * Lexical feature names (=> test if this breaks old code. It should not, however)
