---++ Current deadlines

COLING Deadline August 25

---++ TODO
   * *Implement support for WEKA*
      * Maybe the following issues will be obsolete once we use Weka.
   * Fix (mallet-)support for libsvm and liblinear
   * In a crossfold validation setting, feature extraction should only be performed once.
   * Output/Input folder during Training/Classification should be fixed (-> location of train-data.mallet)
   * Lexical features do not have a name. (new Feature() does not assign a key - just a value)
   * Close writers in a finally-block.
   * Pipeline does not work with Java7

---++ Done
   * Weka support (=> tested with NaiveBayes and a small article set, test some more)
   * Lexical feature names (=> test if this breaks old code. It should not, however)
   * For Weka, we can now perform Crossfold validation, extracting the features only once for each configuration
   * writers get properly closed (and readers and other streams)
   * Inout/output folder during Training/Classification fixed

---++ Notes
   * Articles with inline flaw-markers should be classified only using the section of the article containing the flaw marker
      * OR: features should only be extracted from the section with the marker/template - classification can then be done based on the whole article
