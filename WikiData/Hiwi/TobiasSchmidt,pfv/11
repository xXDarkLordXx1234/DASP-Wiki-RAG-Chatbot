-- Main.TobiasSchmidt - 2021-07-24

---++ Open Issues
   * Hebr√§isches ASR Modell 
   * What happens if someone runs the feature package in a local virtual environment?Need to test this again

---++ 27.09-03.10 (currently; goal)
   * continuing to evaluate our initial test results
   * (mostly) finishing the implementation of the feature extraction package (mostly eye tracking and "cleaning up the code" for reusability)
   * starting documentation
   * if time: starting with a surfboard wrapper

---++ 20.09-26.09
   * uploading our AMT website to the official UKP AMT Account;
   * carry out initial test run for annotations; evaluate results
   * almost finished the implementation of the feature package
---++ 13.09-19.09 
   * sick with doctors note
   
---++ 30.08-12.09 
   * working on the AMT website, fixing smaller problems, qualification test, internal problems,...
   * tried different ASR systems, started thinking about some way to implement the final feature package
   * started with the implementation; mostly, the "general framework" code

---++ 16.08 - 29.08 
   * finishing features from last task (checking whether there are better eye blink detection systems)
   * continue working on the AMT Website
   * Implementing the qualification test via boto3
   * Testing annotation time via MTurk Sandbox
   * Writing up a handout about our current features
   * Checking licenses of used packages for the feature package


---++ 09.08 - 15.08
   * FAU, eye gaze, head position. How much is pre-implemented?
   * Eye closed, eye open, closing speed, gaze spatial distribution over time
   * Search for body gestures out of the box models 
   * Feature list in NextCloud
   * Test Surfboard

---++ 01.08 - 09.08
   * new ASR model for annotation and speech rate
   * document slides (Prosody)
   * Continue making list for related work
   * finish implementing the features from last week

---++ 01.08 - 09.08 
   * Implementing the following features: Pause rate / pause total / pause variability / utterance duration  (split and not split) / speech rate / time talking (with different silence detections)
   * test some transcript models
   * Start making list for related work

---++ 26.07 - 01.08 
   * Implementing the following features: Pause rate / pause total / pause variability / utterance duration  (split and not split) / speech rate / time talking (with different silence detections)
   * test some transcript models
   * Start making list for relted work

---++ 19.07 - 25.07
   * Finished reading last related work papers from the AVEC 2019 challenge; finalised the found feature list and put it into a table.
   * Tried implementing basic functions to extract standard key features from the raw input data via openSMILE while only using python packages. 

---++ 12.07 - 18.07
   * Read more papers, especially related to the AVEC 2019 challenge and the DAIC Corpus. 

---++ 05.07 - 11.07
   * Started researching about multi modal features and searched related work, starting from a reference paper about Deep Spectral Features
   * Began making a list about these features

---++ 01.07 - 04.07
   * Started researching about multi modal features and searched related work, starting from a reference paper about Deep Spectral Features
   * Began making a list about these features
