---++ Open Issues
   * Hebr√§isches ASR Modell 
   * What happens if someone runs the feature package in a local virtual environment?Need to test this again

---++ 07.01-currently:
   * Finishing the reversibility audio problem
   * Thinking about which augmentations we can use for audio that actually influence the data

---++ 01.01-06.01:
   * Finished almost all of the scripts (except T0) and did test on how much the annotations overlap
   * Started reading up on the reversibility of LLD audio features

---++ 21.12-31.12:
   * Started implementing a script to aggregate annotations (using crowdkit)
   * Started a script for automatic toxicity detection (detoxify)
   * Started a script to infer toxicity labels from T0

---++ 13.12-20.12:
   * Implemented changes for the Feature Extractor Package (utterance-wise frame annotations)
   * Uploaded new batch to MTurk
   * Answered questions/comments by participants, did some initial analysis for the data we got

---++ 06.12-12.12:
   * Running PsyQA Experiments, most likely implementing the XLMRoberta and HBert experiments soon
   * Changing the Feature Extract Package s.t. the partners can extract the features
   * Selecting next batch for the Annotation Study and some preparations
   * Read up on automatic toxic detection (T0, detoxify and some others)

---++ 29.11-05.12:
   * Experiments didnt work properly: Debugged the code, tried out different hyperparameters, re-implemented parts, ...
   * Started working on the annotation study again: Re-labeling the annotated data in part, updating the Qualification Test, trying to iron out problems

---++ 22.11-28.11:
   * Got answer from PsyQA people: Re-implemented the Validation experiments from PsyQA and guessed the "correct approach"
   * Debugging the code, running different experiments for PsyQA

---++ 15.11-21.11:
   * Worked with the diarization code, found the problem (too short videos cannot be annotated properly) why it didnt work properly
   * Hand-labeling hebrew data, writing code for evaluation

---++ 01.11 - 14.11:
   * Implemented CV for the PsyQA dataset, where the results were too good
   * Implemented XLM Roberta finetuning for the PsyQA data (also CV)
   * Currently re-training adapters with the new code
   * Uploaded some batch to MTurk, evaluated results some minor things
   * meetings for AI 4 Psych

---++ 25.10 - 31.10:
   * Continued with the adapter training/the chinese corpus; tried out different "counting schemes", of which one seemed correct
   * Wrote code for the Adapter Training / CV training
   * Initial meetings on AI 4 Psych projects

---++ 11.10 - 24.10:
   * trying to reproduce the experiments on the chinese corpus; 
   * Training an adapter to compare performance with chinese RoBERTa
   * Fine tuning BART model to decide if we need to annotate all data
   * getting familiar with slurm, transformers etc.

---++ 03.10 - 10.10 
   * started evaluating the chinese corpus; checking if data is as advertised
   * finished evaluation of the test batches

---++ 27.09-03.10 
   * continuing to evaluate our initial test results
   * (mostly) finishing the implementation of the feature extraction package (mostly eye tracking and "cleaning up the code" for reusability)
   * starting documentation
   * if time: starting with a surfboard wrapper

---++ 20.09-26.09
   * uploading our AMT website to the official UKP AMT Account;
   * carry out initial test run for annotations; evaluate results
   * almost finished the implementation of the feature package
---++ 13.09-19.09 
   * sick with doctors note

---++ 30.08-12.09 
   * working on the AMT website, fixing smaller problems, qualification test, internal problems,...
   * tried different ASR systems, started thinking about some way to implement the final feature package
   * started with the implementation; mostly, the "general framework" code

---++ 16.08 - 29.08 
   * finishing features from last task (checking whether there are better eye blink detection systems)
   * continue working on the AMT Website
   * Implementing the qualification test via boto3
   * Testing annotation time via MTurk Sandbox
   * Writing up a handout about our current features
   * Checking licenses of used packages for the feature package

---++ 09.08 - 15.08
   * FAU, eye gaze, head position. How much is pre-implemented?
   * Eye closed, eye open, closing speed, gaze spatial distribution over time
   * Search for body gestures out of the box models 
   * Feature list in NextCloud
   * Test Surfboard

---++ 01.08 - 09.08
   * new ASR model for annotation and speech rate
   * document slides (Prosody)
   * Continue making list for related work
   * finish implementing the features from last week

---++ 01.08 - 09.08 
   * Implementing the following features: Pause rate / pause total / pause variability / utterance duration  (split and not split) / speech rate / time talking (with different silence detections)
   * test some transcript models
   * Start making list for related work

---++ 26.07 - 01.08 
   * Implementing the following features: Pause rate / pause total / pause variability / utterance duration  (split and not split) / speech rate / time talking (with different silence detections)
   * test some transcript models
   * Start making list for relted work

---++ 19.07 - 25.07
   * Finished reading last related work papers from the AVEC 2019 challenge; finalised the found feature list and put it into a table.
   * Tried implementing basic functions to extract standard key features from the raw input data via openSMILE while only using python packages. 

---++ 12.07 - 18.07
   * Read more papers, especially related to the AVEC 2019 challenge and the DAIC Corpus. 

---++ 05.07 - 11.07
   * Started researching about multi modal features and searched related work, starting from a reference paper about Deep Spectral Features
   * Began making a list about these features

---++ 01.07 - 04.07
   * Started researching about multi modal features and searched related work, starting from a reference paper about Deep Spectral Features
   * Began making a list about these features
