---++ 01.08 - 09.08
   * new ASR model for annotation and speech rate
   * document slides (Prosody)
   * Continue making list for related work
   * finish implementing the features from last week

---++ 01.08 - 09.08 (currently, goal:)
   * Implementing the following features: Pause rate / pause total / pause variability / utterance duration  (split and not split) / speech rate / time talking (with different silence detections)
   * test some transcript models
   * Start making list for related work

   * Implementing the following features: Pause rate / pause total / pause variability / utterance duration  (split and not split) / speech rate / time talking (with different silence detections)
   * test some transcript models
   * Start making list for relted work

---++ 19.07 - 25.07
   * Finished reading last related work papers from the AVEC 2019 challenge; finalised the found feature list and put it into a table.
   * Tried implementing basic functions to extract standard key features from the raw input data via openSMILE while only using python packages. 

---++ 12.07 - 18.07
   * Read more papers, especially related to the AVEC 2019 challenge and the DAIC Corpus. 

---++ 05.07 - 11.07
   * Started researching about multi modal features and searched related work, starting from a reference paper about Deep Spectral Features
   * Began making a list about these features
