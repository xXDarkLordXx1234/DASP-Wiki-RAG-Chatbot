---++ Pedocs ingest script
__Location:__ /srv/scripts/ingestPedocs.pl <br>
__Usage:__  ingestPedocs.pl inputFolder outputFolder <br>
Input folder is the folder (e.g. 2012, 2011 etc.) folders in Pedocs distribution where each PDF is located inside its own folder with source opus ID as the folder name. <br>
Folder names are used to find documents in the pedocs database. During conversion, all files are renamed to "SOURCE_OPUS_ID.EXTENSION". All files (.pdf,.txt,.body,.cite,.header,.parscit,.file,.met) are placed in output folder, buildXML.pl is called for producing XML-files.<br>
After running the script, the documents can be imported by calling batchImport script on the output folder. After that, _public_ -field in the citeseerx databases should be set to 1. _updateInferences_ and _updateIndex_ scripts should be called in order to activate search. 

---++ MyCiteseerx
In order for MyCiteseerx to work we have to enable HTTPS support in Tomcat. 

First, go to tomcat _conf_  folder (e.g. /srv/tomcat/conf). Create key file (Change organization, company name etc.)
<verbatim>
keytool -genkeypair -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keysize 1024 -dname "CN=localhost, OU=Organization, O=Company Name, L=City, S=State, C=US" -validity 365 -keystore keystore
</verbatim>
This will create a file with name " _keystore_ " in the same folder. You will be asked to enter passwords for the key and tomcat.

Second, find " _server.xml_ " in tomcat _conf_ folder. Insert a new Connector:

<verbatim>
<Service name="Catalina">
...
    <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
               maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
               clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS"
               keystoreFile="/srv/tomcat/conf/keystore" keystorePass="csx-devel" />
               
...
</verbatim>
Change _keystoreFile_ and _keystorePass_ according to your values.

After HTTPS has been enabled we have to create some users. This can be done by manually creating a database entry in table _users_ of _myciteseerx_ database or by registering on the portal. In order for registration to work _newAccountsEnabled_  should be set to true in _myciteseerx.configuration_ table. In the same table we can also set other properties like _urlSubmissionsEnabled_  or _peopleSearchEnabled_ .

---++ Homepage statistics
The statistics can be created by executing scripts " _genStats_ " and " _genHomePageStats_ " in seersuite _bin_ folder. The scripts will create statistic files in _stats_ subfolder (e.g. if you execute the scripts in _bin_ folder then the statistic files will be in _bin/stats_ ). Afterwards, the statistic files should be placed in _WEB-INF/stats_ folder of citeseerx webapp. The webapp will read these files and show statistics on the homepage.

If while executing " _genStats_ " or " _genHomePageStats_ " you get an error about missing table "eTables" just go ahead and create this table in _citeseerx_ database with the same structure as " _eAlgorithms_ " table in the same database.

---++ Enabling crawling with Heritrix
Seersuite provides a pre-configured distribution of Heritrix web crawler in "trunk/heritrix" folder. Citeseerx-webapp, Heritrix and Seersuite ingestion services communicate with help of Java Messaging Service API (JMX). There are three types of citeseerx messages:
   * _csx.ingestion.documentsToIngest_ : sent from Heritrix to Seersuite ingestion service, request for ingesting a crawled document
   * _csx.ingestion.newSubmissions_ : sent from Citeseerx webapp to Heritrix after using Submit URL in MyCiteseerx
   * _csx.ingestion.statusUpdates_ : periodically sent from Heritrix to Citeseerx to give updated about crawl status of submitted urls
The communication is performed over ActiveMQ service.
---+++ ActiveMQ
First, we have to download and install ActiveMQ message broker from [[http://activemq.apache.org/download.html][here]].

After extracting archive with ActiveMQ distribution go to _"conf"_ subfolder and open _"activemq.xml"_. If not already set, change _tansportConnector_  to _tcp://localhost:61616_
<verbatim>
<transportConnectors>
            <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://localhost:61616"/>
</transportConnectors>
</verbatim>
After that you can start the ActiveMQ service from activemq/bin folder by executing 
<verbatim>
./activemq start
</verbatim>
To stop the service, run:
<verbatim>
./activemq stop
</verbatim>
ActiveMQ provides an admin webapp that is very useful for managing messages and queues. It can be accessed from browser by going to _http://localhost:8161/admin_.

Finally, copy ActiveMQ JAR library to  _"heritrix/lib"_ folder.

---+++ Heritrix

   1 Copy citeseerx.jar library from _"seersuite/trunk/dist/lib"_ to _"heritrix/lib"_ folder. 
   2 If not installed, install _Slf4j-logger-java_ .
   3 Edit _"heritrix/conf/csx-heritrix.xml"_ and set jmsProvider.url to your ActiveMQ URL. Change clientID, e.g. to _heritrix1_.
   <verbatim>
   <jmsProvider>
    <url>tcp://localhost:61616</url>
	<clientID>heritrix1</clientID>
     ...
</verbatim>
   4 Edit _"heritrix/conf/heritrix.properties"_ and set _heritrix.jobsdir_ to some write-enabled folder, e.g. _"/srv/crawljobs"_
   5 Heritrix service can be started by going to _"heritrix/bin/"_ folder and running _"./heritrix"_
   6 Heritrix can be stopped by running the following command in _"heritrix/bin/"_ folder.  
   <verbatim>
java -jar cmdline-jmxclient-0.10.5.jar controlRole:heritrix localhost:8849 org.archive.crawler:jmxport=8849,name=Heritrix,type=CrawlService,guiport=9080,host=seersuite shutdown
</verbatim>
 Here, _controlRole:heritrix_ is the password set in _"heritrix/jmxremote.password"_; _jmxport=8849_ is the default JMX port set in _"heritrix/bin/hertrix"_ script. 
   7 After starting Hertrix service, the crawler can be administrated via web admin console. It can be accessed from browser by going to _http://localhost:9080/_. The admin console password can be set in _"heritrix/conf/heritrix.properties"_ file. The default username and password are: _isaac:heritrix_
   8 Crawling jobs can be manually created in web console. Citeseerx provides a profile called _"CSX_User_Submission"_ for focused crawling jobs, which are of interest for ingestion (e.g. PDF documents).  The newly created jobs are first pending. To start crawling 
   
---+++ Citeseerx
Go to _"seersuite/trunk/conf"_ folder and open _csx.config.properties_. If not set, change:
<verbatim>
activemq.url=tcp://localhost:61616
</verbatim>

After enabling Submit URL function in MyCiteseerx, the submitted urls are directly sent to ActiveMQ queue, which is then delivered to Heritrix that starts crawling after receiving the message.
The next step is to configure Seersuite ingestion services to listen to _csx.ingestion.documentsToIngest_ messages and performing ingestion.
