---++++Design options for UKP-LSR
 
   1 Avoid information loss
      * mapping of all resources to LMF; results in a Meta Resource (MR)
      * resources are aligned on linguistic annotation level (so-called semantic interoperability), i.e., the meaning/word sense of linguistic categories, such as lexeme,"lemma", "syntactic argument"  is consistent across all resources
      * alignment on word sense level only partially available
   2 Intersection of resources regarding linguistic annotation types
      * Wikipedia, Wiktionary, !WordNet (!GermaNet), !FrameNet (SALSA Lexicon), !OmegaWiki: common linguistic annotation types seem to be lemma, (resource-specific) definition of Word Sense, semantic relations
      * focus on semantic relations, loss of syntactic, morpho-syntactic annotations and some semantic annotations (e.g., semantic arguments of verbs)
      * fully integrated and aligned subset can be generated; this subset can easily be provided both in LMF and RDF/OWL (and possibly additional formats)
   3 Combination of 1 and 2: Generate a fully integrated LSR from MR

---+++++Representation issues:

   * *Representation of word sense alignment*
      * word sense alignment between resources in the same language 
      * bilingual lexicon representation: alignment of corresponding word senses in different languages

   * Options for representation of word sense alignment 
      * direct link from one word sense to corresponding word sense in another resource
      * indirect connection of word senses via abstract concept/interlingual entity

   * *Representation of added linguistic annotations*
      * automatically induced linguistic annotations (for instance, additional semantic relations)
      * manually added annotations, for instance corrections of errors

   * Options for representation of added linguistic annotations
      * automatically induced information could be represented in LMF; source information should be included
