| hours left from the year 2012 | 31.12.2012 | -23.25 | <ul><li> 320 (from the contract of year 2012) - 270.75 (worked) - 26 (holidays after consultation with Prof. Gurevych)  = -23.25 </li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 09.01.2013 | 2 | <ul><li> had a look to mate tools; read the code of Marcel to inflection; wrote an email to Marcel, and asked because of 2 missed files; wrote an email to György to some not understandable points of tasks </li></ul> |
| WSD | 14.01.2013 | 2.5 | <ul><li> email traffic; read tasks to WSD; read de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.examples.Senseval2EnglishAllWords.java and modified so it runs at me; read de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.wsd.examples.Senseval2EnglishLexicalSample.java, TODO from this class: "to have theWordNet 1.7 prerelease installed on your local system, and to have an appropriately configured WordNet properties file and DKPro resources.xml file" </li></ul> |
| SIDIM, WSD | 16.01.2013 | 1.25 | <ul><li> email traffic; a look to 120912_SiDiM_Zwischenbericht_TUD.pdf; skype with György, was clarified: what is to upload; how to change then code; how should be the watemarking annotator adapted </li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 18.01.2013 | 6.75 | <ul><li>  email and skype traffic with Marcel, György and Richard (to deployment of sidim and inflection); added inflection to the watermarking annotators, according to the code by Marcel Ackermann; couldn't test it, because I need to know with which file is the Inflecter  to initialize - asked Marcel in the last email to him (but it should work)</li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 19.01.2013 | 2 | <ul><li>  looked with wich file is the Inflecter to initialize; Email to Marcel; backup of data; read emails of Richard and documentation proposed by him to deployment </li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 21.01.2013 | 4 | <ul><li> read on 20. report of Tristan; some email traffic; translated a part of the report </li></ul> |

| SIDIM | 23.01.2013 | 4.75 | <ul><li> translated the rest of the first part; translated the second part (3 sentences); read both parts one more time and improved, where it was needed </li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 26.01.2013 | 2 | <ul><li> became the name of model from Marcel; there is a problem with loading of this from classpath, after some unsuccessful attempts loaded it at first from absolute path; exceptions - fixed it - Annotation slightly adjusted </li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 28.01.2013 | 3.75 | <ul><li> tested the annotation, there was impossible to access covered text of alternaives, which don't have this, changed this to lemma; in the output were alternatives just for one head, will check next time, why only for one </li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 29.01.2013 | 6.75 | <ul><li> done watermark annotation -> send code and output to György, became feedback from him, skype to clarify it; studied the output; checked which words are in the dictionary; if some word will be not found in the dictionary than will be null returned, this will be just dropped: compared to the previous version, which has taken lemmas instead; commit </li><li> looked for tutorials for deployment, viewed some, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIY34n1HMsY; downloaded maven and updated environment pathes; executed "mvn deploy" and "mvn package", both had errors, the first was because the version "Latest" couldn't  be resolved, changet it to exact versions; installed certificate for "scruffy.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de"; current error at run "mvn deploy" is "Non-resolvable parent POM:..."  </li></ul> |

| SIDIM | 12.02.2013 | 3.25 | <ul><li> two meetings with Richard: short description of this at email to György; email to György; couldn't log on to this wiki website -> email to Timo; wrote down ToDo list for sidim (e.g. the 1. task is to test, that it runs after changes) </li></ul> |
| SIDIM | 13.03.2013 | 1.25 | <ul><li> skype with György due to the last email with questions to deployment process; tested projects after switch to open source resources -> errors (couldn't find some class); email to Iryna, Chris and Martin </li></ul> |
