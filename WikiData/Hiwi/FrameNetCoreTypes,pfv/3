|Non-Core|Extra-Thematic|


*JEK*: (source: Language resource management  Semantic annotation framework  Part 5: Semantic Roles (SemAF-SRL))
   * core: conceptually necessary for the definition of the frame (e.g Cook and Food in Apply_heat)
   * peripheral: not specific to the frame, but providing additional information, such as time and place; roughly similar to adjuncts
   * extra-thematic: not part of the current frame, but related to another frame that frequently co-occurs with it
   * @Question(SH): But why is under this definition Core-Unexpressed Non-core?
