---+++++ Chinese Whispers clustering results including keywords and number of occurrences per cluster:

   * [[ClemensDeusserCluster1][Version 1 / 10 iterations / 22 cluster / normalised edges]]

Sample results using tf*idf and CW randomization seeds:

   * [[ClemensDeusserCluster2][Version 2 / 10 iterations / 3 cluster / seed:2 / normalised edges / tf*idf / cutting edges below average weight]]
   * [[ClemensDeusserCluster3][Version 2 / 10 iterations / 3 cluster / seed:4 / normalised edges / tf*idf / cutting edges below 1.5 * average weight]]
   * [[ClemensDeusserCluster4][Version 2 / 10 iterations / 6 cluster / seed:1 / normalised edges / tf*idf / cutting edges below twice average weight]]

Results very similar, all have a very large single cluster with the majority of nodes.

---+++++ Keywords in both Fachsystematik and pedocs:

Number of keywords occurring in both FS and pedocs: ~190
   * [[ClemensDeusserFSPedocsKeywords1][Per document, in SQL statements]]
   * [[ClemensDeusserFSPedocsKeywords2][Across database, in plain text]]

---+++++ PEDOCS and Fachsystematik

Pedocs is a database of over 3000 papers pertaining to pedagogy. The relevant information per document contained in this database is the title, a short description (abstract), the author(s), the date, publication information and a number of keywords. The Fachsystematik provides consistent identifiers for pedagogic papers according to their topic. While pedocs does have a field "FS_Keys", it does not appear to be used, so usage of the FS to determine the topic seems to be infeasible.
