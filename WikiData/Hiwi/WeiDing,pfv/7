[[WeiDingTimes][Time tracking]]


---++ 2017-11-03 Meeting
   * renew contract
   * 2 !ActiveLearning strategies:
      * Strategy A: the predictions are ordered by confidence (ascending).
         * this one is already implemented in recommendation model.
      * Strategy B: When showing the predictions, order (ascending) by the difference between weights (regardless of the classifier) for every word.
      * For the moment, strategy B will be the default, but in the future, we can easily configure to switch between different strategies, as well as add new strategies
   * Checked with Peter: 
      * recommendations are being generated for suggestions that have already been chosen by the user. So the !recommendationList from recommendation model contains all the recommendations even for those already accepted tokens
      * it is possible that one classifier gives different predictions to the same token
   * For storing data in the database, look at !entityManager. The accepted recommendations should already been stored in database.
   * Question: When getting recommendations from the recommender system, should we get them only for the current document/page?
      * getPrediction only retrieves recommendations for the current document
      * If they would come from all documents in a project, the AL sidebar should jump to the corresponding document/page when showing a new recommendation
   * To do
      * show more information about recommendation like confidence, classifier in log so that easy to debug later
      * filter recommendations for tokens which already been taken
      * implement strategy B
      * refine strategy A in active learning model


---++ 2017-11-03 Meeting
   * handing over timesheets
   * fix the serializable error and push to incrementalTrainer master branch
   * To do
      * write the function to accept button, after clicking, the recommendation will be saved in memory, be shown in annotationBrat and be recorded in !LearningHistory
      * use !ListView component for !LearningHistory
      * after finishing this function, try to store in database


---++ 2017-10-25 Meeting
   * Created a new issue in Git for me #51, keep my feature active learning branch, pull from master branch and push to my feature branch
   * Discussed how to [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/ActiveLearningGiveRecommendationLogic.jpg][give recommendations]] in Active Learning:
      * Give user the recommendations word by word
      * Get all confidences for tokens in the document and sort them from low to high in a recommendationList
      * Show user the recommendation of lowest confidence at first
         * If user accepts this recommendation, remove other recommendations for this token from the recommendationList
         * If user rejects this recommendation, remove this recommendation from the recommendationList
      * Keep the learned words in Learning History
   * Discussed the functional details behind each button and the layout of activeLearningSidebar
      * If start learning, the layer dropDownChoice should be disabled. And the value of start button should be changed to stop.The rest part of sidebar should be hidden until start learning
      * In the place of Learning Curve, replace it with Recommendation, so that user can accept or reject the recommendations here. So move the 2 buttons after Learning History to here
   * To do
      * Update the mockup active learning sidebar
      * Try to get the list of confidences



---++ 2017-10-17 Meeting
   * How to choose instances to query considering the classifiers, whether we give the user multiple suggestions for the instance with regard to the confidence of one classifier or we give multiple suggestions from different classifiers. *In the moment, we should focus on the suggestions from one classifier.*
   * If the suggestions are wrong, we should provide the function for users to delete it. How can users do the changes? *In the future, this point will be discussed again.*
   * Richard has explained !DocumentInfoSiderbarFactory and !DocumentInfoSidebar classes.
   * To do
      * implement a simple sidebar for active learning to know more about Wicket Framework
      * think about the implementation of functionality of activeLearningSidebar



---++ 2017-10-09 Meeting
   * Got to know Beto
   * Introduced project [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/INCEpTION-ActiveLearning.jpg][INCEpTION-ActiveLearning]]
   * Downloaded source code and set the environment
   * To do
      * to create WikiPage
      * to be familiar with the source code from class "SearchAnnotationSideBar.java"
      * to be familiar with !INCEpTION application
      * to be familiar with Wicket
