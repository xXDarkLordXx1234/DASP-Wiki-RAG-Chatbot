(temp, motivation)

Scientific literature digital libraries provide various functionalities to search, classify, or structure information according to some criteria such as author, title, conference, or by full text search. Moreover, complex features such as citation indexing and linking, related documents search, full-text indexing, and context related search are state of the art in modern digital libraries. However, for specific scientific disciplines, search functionality according to other criteria is needed in order to keep track in the vast amount of publications. For example, chemists may be interested in publications containing the mention of specific molecules, or researchers in educational science whose work is driven by individual methods are interested in scientific work using exactly these methodic approaches. Some information might be obviously accessible, for example in terms of metadata, others are given implicitly or not at all, and therefore have to be generated by appropriate techniques from existing data by combination, propagation, and inference in order to promote an efficient search process.

In this thesis, we will present an NLP powered graph-based system for classifying scientific papers in the field of education.
