b.) [TASK: Check if lexical information from salsa_frames.xml is converted . Therefore, compare the instance counts of the corresponding xml-tags and UBY classes]

salsa_frames.xml	UBY
<frame>: 1023		SemanticPredicate: 1023
<fe>: 5024		SemanticArgument: 5024
<lexunit>: 1827		Sense: 1826
<lexeme>: 649		LexicalEntry: 648


c.) [TASK: Analyse two instances of <frame> from salsa_frames.xml and check if the information contained is mapped correctly to the UBY format.] 

Analysed <frame> instances: 'Abnehmer1-salsaâ€˜, 'Abwesenheit1-salsa'

- Is there a SemanticPredicate entry in the DB with label? 
YES

- is it associated with a Definition containing the text in the definition tag? 
YES

- Is it associated with four SemanticArguments with the given labels and definitions and coreType information?
YES

- Is it associated with one Sense and one LexicalEntry with the given Lemma and pos?
YES 

- Is it associated with Frequency information (filled with information from the <annotated> tag in salsa_frames.xml)?
YES

I collected the information by querying the DB directly. I also tried using the uby api, which worked out fine for question 1-3, however I was not able to collect the associated Sense information that way.
