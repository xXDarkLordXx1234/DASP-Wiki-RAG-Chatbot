---++ Last Timesheet:
   * 31.12.

---++ 2015-12-21
   * next meeting: 2016-01-11 (12:00)
   * @todo:
      * experiment with pre-training / representation learning
      * Autoencoders:
         * http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/
         * http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Stacked_Autoencoders
         * http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Fine-tuning_Stacked_AEs
      * http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2145450
      * Restricted Boltzman Machine (RBM) as alternative to autoencoders?
      * Document results in a table
      * Difference between common MLP and pretrained is interesting
      * Is dropout in encoding layers included in the MLP model (MLP1-pretrained.py)
      * Define the vector space from training or unlabeled data? (CS: I guess from unlabeled data makes more sense). 


---++ 2015-12-07
   * next meeting: 12:00
   * @info(CS): Contract extension?! Is it right that your current contract ends end of december?
   * @info(CS): Discuss status of current tasks and next steps
      * Clarified the design of the iterative save procedure
         * Concert nested i*k structure in one list (list containing all the experiments)
         * Save result of experiments as an appended file including a dictionary for each experiment
         * After all experiments convert the stored file into a list format
         * Hint: Implement one method which can read list AND appended dictionary files to facilitate the task

---++ 2015-11-30
   * @info(CD): Implemented Parallelization of MLP
   * @discuss: LSTM model does not work
      * try to run example from the Nils' deep learning course
      * check data encoding; the approach might require to encode the data as sequence
      * You can also take a look at rnn
   * @todo
      * Extend the project so that the results of each iteration are saves securely
      * Make sure that an interrupted experiment can be resumed without running all iterations



---++ 2015-11-23
   * @discuss(CS): Parallelization 
   * @discuss(CS): Slight difference in the results.. What can we do?
   * @discuss(CS): !F1-macro-impl1 vs F1-macro-impl2
   * @duscuss(CS): Open Tasks from last week
      * Task1: Parallelize MLP1.py
      * Task2: Get familiar with LSTMs and RNN see lecture 6
         * Are these models suited for *document classification*? If so, why? Are those better for document classification than CNN
         * Is there an implementation that we can try with our data? if so, try it :)

---++ 2015-11-16
   * Task1: Parallelize the CNN code
      * make #cores configurable
   * Task2: Try to run it on GPU
   * Task3: Get familiar with LSTMs and x(?) see lecture 6
      * Are these models suited for *document classification*? If so Why? Are those better for document classification than CNN
      * Is there an implementation that we can try with our data? if so, try it :)

---++ 2015-11-05
   * time: 10:00
   * Workshop Gold Standard Creation

---++ 2015-10-19
   * time: 10:00
   * @info(CS): current agreement scores
   * @info(CS): In the next annotation we will focus on sufficiency only and annotate as much as possible
      * starting at essay_21
      * *targeted deadline 9.11.*
   * @discuss(CD): suggestions for labels
      * Maybe judge good vs bad arguments before assessing the RSA-categories to filter out good arguments in advance?!

---++ 2015-10-05
   * @info(CS): annotated 51 arguments
   * @info(CS): Relevance and Acceptability is still bad
      * We will consider relevance only in the standard form and expect that there will be few cases of it
      * Acceptability considers really bad cases and unwarranted claims which directly support the major claim
      * We will not consider reformulations as relevance anymore.
   * @todos
      * Re-annotate 51 arguments and write down justifications for the decisions, mainly focus on acceptability and relevance (deadline 9.10.2015 CTB)
      * Find other categories which we could annotate (until next meeting 19.10. at 10:00)

---++ 2015-08-10
