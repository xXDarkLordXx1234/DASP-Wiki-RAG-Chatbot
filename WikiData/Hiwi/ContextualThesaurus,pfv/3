---+Contextual Thesaurus

This page documents our work on the next level of the DistributionalThesaurus (DT),
the *Contextual Thesaurus*.

The implementation to this research is based on a local UIMA pipeline (i.e. the
Cluster is not used here). It relies on the output of the *ContextParses* step,
see the corresponding paragraph at the DT page.
The goal of this second	version is to examine whether or not a _local context_
could help with automatic similarity (or disambiguation) calculation.

The current results are very promising.
