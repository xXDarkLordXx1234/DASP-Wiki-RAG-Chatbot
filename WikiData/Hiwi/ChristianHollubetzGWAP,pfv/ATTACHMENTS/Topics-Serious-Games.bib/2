	We show that top-ranked Foldit players excel at solving challenging
	structure refinement problems in which substantial backbone rearrangements
	are necessary to achieve the burial of hydrophobic residues. Players
	working collaboratively develop a rich assortment of new strategies
	and algorithms; unlike computational approaches, they explore not

	has demonstrated the potential of human computation in solving AI-hard

	for questions proposed by the system, e.g., descriptions about a
	picture or a song. Since users may bring up irrelevant inputs intentionally
	or carelessly, and often the system does not have "correct" answers,
	we have to rely on the users to verify answers from others. We call
	this kind of mutual verification of users' answers "social verification."
	
	
	In this paper, we propose formal models for two fundamental social
	verification mechanisms, simultaneous verification and sequential
	verification, in human computation systems. By adopting a game-theoretic
	approach, we perform an equilibrium analysis which explains the effect
	of each verification mechanism on a system's outcome. Our analysis
	results show that sequential verification leads to a more diverse
	and descriptive set of outcomes than simultaneous verification, though
	the latter is stronger in ensuring the correctness of verified answers.
	Our experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which asked users to input
	textual terms related to a word, confirmed our analysis results.
	We believe that our formal models for social verification mechanisms

	IT knowledge portfolio. A second characteristic are the incentives
	that are largely missing in the design of most semantic applications.
	The benefits of using machine-understandable content are in most
	applications fully decoupled from the effort of creating and maintaining
	this content. In other words, users do not have a motivation to contribute
	to the process. Initiatives in the areas of the Social Semantic Web
	acknowledged this problem, and identified mechanisms to motivate
	users to dedicate more of their time and resources to participate
	in the semantic content creation process. Still, even if incentives
	are theoretically in place, available human labor is limited and
	must only be used for those tasks that are heavily dependent on human
	intervention, and cannot be reliably automated. In this article,
	we concentrate on this step in between. As a first contribution,
	we analyze the process of semantic content creation in order to identify
	those tasks that are inherently human-driven. When building semantic
	applications involving these specific tasks, one has to install incentive
	schemes that are likely to encourage users to perform exactly these
	tasks that crucially rely on manual input. As a second contribution
	of the article, we propose incentives or incentive-driven tools that
	can be used to increase user interest in semantic content creation
	tasks. We hope that our findings will be adopted as recommendations
	for establishing a fundamentally new form of design of semantic applications
	by the semantic technologies community.},

	Recently, online games have been proposed as a new way of obtaining
	labeled data; games attract users by being fun to play. In this paper,
	we consider the application of this idea to collecting semantic relations
	between words, such as hypernym/hyponym relationships. We built three
	online games, inspired by the real-life games of ScattergoriesTM
	and TabooTM . As of June 2008, players have entered nearly 800,000
	data instances, in two categories. The first type of data consists
	of category/answer pairs (“Types of vehicle”,“car”), while the second
	is essentially free association data (“submarine”,”underwater”).
	We analyze both types of data in detail and discuss potential uses
	of the data. We show that we can extract from our data set a significant
	number of new hypernym/hyponym pairs not already found in WordNet.},
