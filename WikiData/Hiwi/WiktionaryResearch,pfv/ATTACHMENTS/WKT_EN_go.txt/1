{{rank|day|through|himself|117|go|how|long|am}}

===Etymology 1===
{{etyl|enm}} {{term|gon|lang=enm}}, from {{etyl|ang}} {{term|gan|gān|lang=ang}}, from {{proto|Germanic|gēną}} (cf. {{etyl|fy|-}} ''gean'', Dutch {{term|gaan}}, German {{term|gehen}}, {{etyl|da|-}} ''gå''), from {{proto|Indo-European|g̑ʰēh-}} 'to leave' (compare Albanian n''gaj'' 'to run', Ancient Greek ''kikhānein'' 'to meet with, arrive at', Avestan ''zazāmi'' 'I leave off', Sanskrit ''jáhāti'' 'he leaves'). Inherited past tense forms (compare {{etyl|ang}} {{term|eode|ēode|lang=ang}}), however, have since the 15th century been replaced by forms from {{etyl|ang}} {{term|wendan|lang=ang}} 'to go, depart, wend'; this process is called [[suppletion]].
* [[w:Go (etymology)|Detailed Wikipedia article on ''go''’s etymology]]

''Go'', along with {{term|do}}, {{term|make}}, and to a lesser extent other English verbs, is often used as a substitute verb for a verb used previously or one that is implied, in the same way a {{term|pronoun}} substitutes for a {{term|noun}}. For example:
: ''Chris: Then he '''goes''' like this:'' (Chris waves arms around, implying the phrase means ''Then he moves his arms like this'').
