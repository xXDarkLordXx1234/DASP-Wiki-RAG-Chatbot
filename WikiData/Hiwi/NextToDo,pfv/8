   * Fix multi-field index problem. (The Dragon!)

Before the meeting, please<br/>
 1) see if you can create a field with a custom name, put all index terms in it, and retrieve<br/>
 2) find in which part of DKPro IR or Terrier code merging of scores for each field are taking place,<br/>
 3) find a way to debug (printing to screen is fine) scoring of each field<br/>
