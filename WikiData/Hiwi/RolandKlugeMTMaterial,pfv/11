   * *argumentum* (Latin rethoric, according to Judith's lexicon)
      * Principles of proving/procedures: _a. exclusionis_, _a. e contrario_: prove that the counterclaim is false, _a. fortiori_: proof by concluding from already proven claims, _a. ex concesso_: (similar to previous), proof by concluding from already acknowledged claim, _a. negativum_
      * Categorization based on sentence structure: _a. priori_ vs. _a. posteri_

   * "The overall aim of this book is to present formalizations of aspects of monological argumentation"
   * *Information classes*: certain/categorical ("Paris is in France"), uncertain/probabilistic ("The sun will rise tomorrow"), objective ("A study found that 80%..."), subjective ("I prefer to..."), hypothetical("The sea level will rise by 100m")
   * *Agent*: autonomous, intelligent, proactive system (voter, journalist, scientist,...)
   * *Entity*: set of agents with single role
   * Classification by participants:
      * *Monological* argumentation: focus on _result_; single entity/agent collects information and combines arguments; no dialogue; e.g. newspaper article, political speech/manifesto, scientific review
      * *Dialogical* argumentation: focus on _process_; interaction between entities; extension of monologue by incorporating other entities; e.g. political debate, negotiating traders, debating politicians
   * Classification by information: factual (to inform objectively); positional (to inform about personal beliefs); persuasional (to persuade); provocational (to motivate to think further; satire/sarcasm/...); speculational (to speculate/to inform about potential risks)
   * Classification by target: auto-argumentation (proponent=audience); one-to-many argumentation

---++ Paper summaries
(subsections ordered by title)

---+++ Argumentation mining by Raquel Mochales and Marie-Francine Moens 
   * argumentation in law
   * *Argumentation scheme*: argument = premises + conclusion/proposition/claim (anything beyond is "controversial", p.4)
      * most arguments have implicit parts [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthymeme][Enthymeme]]
      * need to distinguish "argument" from "statement" (context!)
      * based on Walton, 1996: identify argumentation schemes by relations among propositions
   * *Data*: Araucaria corpus (641 arg.includes newspaper articles), ECHR corpus
   * *Classification*: MaxEnt (for argumentative/non-argumentative), SVM (for premise/conclusion)
      * *Features* for MaxEnt: 1-/2-/3-grams; adverbs; verbs; modal auxilaries; word couples; text statistics; punctuations; key words; parse features(depth, num. subclauses)
      * *Features* for SVM: position in doc.; sent. length; tense of main verb; context labels; discursive cues; ...
   * *'Argumentative Parsing'*: 
      * CFG-based approach
   * *Reference*: [[http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/publicaties/lirias/mypubs.php?unum=U0054309][bib]]

---+++ Argument Mining by Applying Argumentation Schemes by Walton
   * List of 29 most general argumentation schemes (p.3)
   * Sec. 7 summarizes the state-of-the-art in AM

---+++ Automatic Argumentation Extraction by Sergeant
   * Work in progress
   * Pipeline: argument identification (also called proposition) -> classification by type (premise, conclusion) -> identification of relationships (tree-like argumentation graph)
   * *Objective*: "This research aims to provide decision support [...], enabling a decision maker to follow more closely the reasoning process, to examine premises and counter-arguments, and to reach better informed decisions."
      * "[Argument] Identification is the task of determining the conclusion, premises and scheme of an argument*
      * "What is an argument? The building blocks of every argument are propositions: a statement or assertion that expresses a judgement or opinion. An argument consists of two or more propositions, one proposition functions as the claim (also known as the conclusion), and a set of one or more propositions serve as supports (also known as premises). The relationship between the propositions (premises and conclusions) is important"
   * *Annotation*: What level of annotation?
      * preliminary results on Car Review Corpus (CRC): "highlight the fact that sentences are not appropriate  as the fundamental elements of an argument"

---+++ [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1276362][Automatic detection of argumentation in legal texts]]

   * strong focus on argumentation in legal texts (seems to be a lot of previous work there!)
   * Prominent features: "lexical cues, pronouns and other forms of phoric reference, and tense and aspec", "adverbial groups"
   * *Level*: classify each sentence in isolation
   * *Features*: 1-/2-/3-grams, adverbs, full verbs, modals (binary), word couples (all possible pairs), punct, arg. keywords, sentence statistics (word/sent. length)
      * Argumentation cues come from:  A. Knott and R. Dale. Using linguistic phenomena to motivate a set of rhetorical relations. Technical Report HCRC/RP-39, Edinburgh, Scotland, 1993.
   * *Classifier*: Multinomial Naive Bayes, MaxEnt

---+++ Automatic extraction of knowledge from student essays
   * survey of annotation schemes
   * presents a lot of argumentation schemes

---+++ Identifying Comparative Claim Sentences in Full-Text Scientific Articles
   * *Features (excerpt)*
      * L1: boolean, check for presence of *comparison keywords* from 'SPECIALIST lexicon' (Browne, McCray, & Srinivasan, 2000)
         * modification: "We modified the lexicon by adding terms in {better&#8223;, more&#8223;, less&#8223;, worse&#8223;, fewer&#8223;, lesser&#8223;} and removing terms in {few&#8223;, good&#8223;, ill&#8223;, later&#8223;, long-term&#8223;, low-dose&#8223;, number&#8223;, well&#8223;, well-defined&#8223;}"
      * L2: boolean, check for presence of *direction verbs* from inhouse-produced lexicon
      * L3/L4/L5/L6: boolean, sentence contains one of *{from, over, above}*, *versus/vs.*, *twice the*, *{times that of, half that of, third that of, fourth that of}*
      * more (syntactic) features based on a similarity-and-diffence lexicon (SIMDIF, 31 terms)
    * *Classifiers:* Naive Bayes, SVM, Bayesian Networks
   
---+++ Recognizing Arguing Subjectivity and Argument Tags

   * Field: "arguing subjectivity"
   * Dataset: blog posts and open editorial entries dealing with "ObamaCare"
   * Annotation unit: Argument="... spans of 1 sentence or less in which a writer 'conveys a controversial private state concerning what she believes to be true or what action she believes should be taken'
   * In political science, there seems to be some kind of "arguing dimension"
   * Features: "investigate the utility of a sentiment lexicon, discourse parser, and semantic similarity measures with respect to recognizing arguments."
       * Discourse? Discourse parser by Lin, using Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) tagset. (Lin et al., Automatically evaluating text coherence using discourse relations.),
       * Sentiment score? Lexicon with lemmas being marked as strong/weak. Mark sentence if num. of words with strong(weak) sent. score is two(three) or more (Theresa Wilson. 2005. Recognizing contextual polarity in phrase-level sentiment analysis. In EMNLP, pages 347354.)
