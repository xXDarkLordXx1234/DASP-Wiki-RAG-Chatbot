---+++ Questions

   * UKP-specific header for source code?

---+++ 2012-08-31 Notes

   * Test jars (located at public-ext-releases-local):
      * com.nexus.kaptcha:kaptcha:2.0
      * org.archive.crawler:heritrix:1.14.2
      * de.nava.informa:informa:0.6.5
      * com.advsofteng:ChartDirector.jar:5.0.x
      * uk.ltd.getahead:dwr:1.1.4 
   * Does there exist a admin interface?
   * Read annotated_bibliography
   * "Clustered Documents": purpose?
   * Keywords Showcase
      * Tool generates keywords for all documents
      * Keywords are show inside a box next to the document (just like BibTeX refs)
      * How to integrate into MyCiteseerX?
   *  Make MyCiteseerX run
      * locally
      * What about Captcha problems? Deactivation possible?

---++++ Mid-term goals (Use Cases)
   *  As a researcher, I want to semiautomatically tag documents which have not been tagged manually, yet.
      * The application provides a set of proposed tags, derived by determining a suitable cluster for the given document.
      * I may add custom tags.
   * As a researcher, I want to see proposed documents when I select a specific document.
      * Proposed documents a somewhat similar to the current document, i.e., they belong to the same cluster and/or have a small distance to it.
   * As a researcher, I want to see a visualization of the cluster of the current document
      * The visualization may be integrated in a similar fashion like the Citegraph.

---++++ Outstanding Tasks
   1 Examine how Algorithm/Table search may be replaced with domain-specific search (-> HowTo)
   1 Preparations for adding categories to documents
      * Find appropriate integration into DB (represent hierarchy of categories)
      * Which new DAOs are required? 
      * Write HowTo on how to add new SQL queries to the system
      * explore how cluster visualization may be integrated (like Citegraph)
      * design database/table (Foreign keys?) -> SQL script
      * create sample data or wait for Clemens
   1 _low priority_ Get MyCiteseer to run (locally)
      * contact Yevgen for information on that 
   1 SVN repository
      * check in current version
      * test checked-in version on another PC
      * write HowTo for local customization (e.g. scripts...) 
      * script for localizing repository locations (applicationContext-csx-jdbc.xml)
   1 Seersuite<->DKPro
      * How to integrate DKPro functionality into Seersuite (design)
   1 Reverse engineer database
      * landscape view of tables and relationships (Wolfgang?)

---++++ Done Tasks

---+++ 2012-07-26 Notes

   * Done Tasks:
      1 *Cancelled* Convert SeerSuite project to Maven project -> jar file can easily be installed/deployed 
      1 Preparations for SVN publishing
         * Create SVN repository at https://scruffy.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/third_party/seersuite (Wolfgang?)
         * Locate all absolute paths
         * Build a script for adapting seersuite check-out to local setup
      1 Document Eclipse tooling (Tomcat integration etc.)
      1 Examine further pipeline steps
         * *not possible* Configure de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.io.pdf.PdfReader to accept any type of PDF file (not only those prefixed with "[+]" or "[-]" - maybe contact project lead)
         * "CollectionReader": String to CAS
         * Extract CAS object at end of the pipeline
