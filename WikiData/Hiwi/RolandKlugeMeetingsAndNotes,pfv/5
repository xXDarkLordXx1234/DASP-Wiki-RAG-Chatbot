---+++ 2012-07-26 Notes

   * Outstanding Tasks
      1 Convert SeerSuite project to Maven project -> jar file can easily be installed/deployed
      1 Document Eclipse tooling (Tomcat integration etc.)
      1 Preparations for SVN publishing
         * Create SVN repository at https://scruffy.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/dkpro/third_party/seersuite
         * Locate all absolute paths
         * Build a script for adapting seersuite check-out to local setup
      1 Examine further pipeline steps
         * Configure de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.io.pdf.PdfReader to accept any type of PDF file (not only those prefixed with "[+]" or "[-]" - maybe contact project lead)
         * "CollectionReader": String to CAS (wait for code snippet from Wolfgang)
         * Extract CAS object at end of the pipeline (code snippet?)
      1 Examine how Algorithm/Table search may be replaced with domain-specific search (-> HowTo)
      1 Preparations for adding categories to documents
         * Find appropriate integration into DB (represent hierarchy of categories)
         * Which new DAOs are required?

---+++ Open Questions

   * *TODO* Can I force PDFReader to accept PDF files not starting with "[+]" or "[-]"?

---+++Technical

   * Problem with nested JSPs?
      * "account cannot be resolved" in _citeseerx/web/citeseerx_webapp/WEB-INF/jsp/shared_
      * "account cannot be resolved to a variable"
      * "mscConfig cannot be resolved"
   * Missing artifacts, but could be resolved?
