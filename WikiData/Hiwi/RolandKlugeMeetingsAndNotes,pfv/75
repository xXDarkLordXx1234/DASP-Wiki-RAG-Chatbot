---++++ Forking SIG_KDSL.EduSeer:

   * @question(RK) which is the newest version of SIG_KDSL.EduSeer? Ask WS!
   * Fundamental question: *to fork or not to fork*?
   * Latest release online: http://sourceforge.net/projects/citeseerx/files/citeseerx/beta-0.12/
   * License: Apache 2.0
   * Pro forking:
      * full control
      * a lot of effort has already been put into migrating SIG_KDSL.EduSeer to Spring (Security) 3.1.0
      * development at PSU is quite slow, only rare updates (revision 10 in mid 2012, http://citeseerx.sourceforge.net/)
      * architecture needs some reviews (e.g. use of generics etc.)
         * SIG_KDSL.EduSeer (rev. 10) is quite buggy (db queries, web links, etc.)
         * full of development code - no unit tests etc.
         * (very) old versions of several libraries/components: Solr
      * the usual way to use the SIG_KDSL.EduSeer is forking (??): http://seerseer.ist.psu.edu/, http://chemxseer.ist.psu.edu/, 
         * @question(RK): how do these guys incorporate updates of SIG_KDSL.EduSeer?
      * independence of actual development at PSU 
         * @action(JEK) what about e-mail response from developers?
      * ...
   * Contra forking
      * duplicate work (in Pennsylvania and in Darmstadt)
      * no cooperation (possible)?
      * need a responsible person for maintaining the project
      * extra effort for making the project open source (which may/may not be sensible)
      * need for better integration into Maven infrastructure? -> not as much scripting as currently, more user-friendly
      * Not every change to the user interface will be possible without modifying parts of the source code, e.g. disabling Table/Algorithm search, show/hide citations
      * ...

---++++ Plugin Concept

   * Plugin points
      * content boxes - see Keyphrase Extraction, only affects ViewDocController
      * sections (add information below citations) - see Document Clustering: cluster of document, neighbor clusters, only affects ViewDocController
      * new sites - see Document Clustering: overview of clusters, overview of keywords, etc.
      * more?
   * Content Boxes
      * =ContentBoxProvider= which delivers instances of =ContentBox= (title; content as HTML)
      * for the content: use approritate template engine
   * Sections
      * =SectionProvider= which delivers instances of =DocumentInformationSection= (title; content as HTML)
      * for the content: use approritate template engine
   * Plugin Sites
      * register new DispatcherServlet for URLS of the form _/plugin/[plugin_name]_
      * the dispatcher tries to fetch the appropriate Controller for [plugin_name] and redirects the request to it
   * @question(RK) Can we use Javascript with this approach?

---++++ Todos - Tasks to be done

  * add Kaptcha 2.3.2 to Maven Artifactory
  * start Tomcat instances from Eclipse (two instances for Solr+Axis and SIG_KDSL.EduSeer)

---+++ 2013-02-18 Notes

   * Inform about Vivo
   * Are all titles in imported Pedocs data unique?
      * =SELECT COUNT( title ) FROM `papers`= -> 3409
      * =SELECT DISTINCT COUNT( title ) FROM `papers`= -> 3409

---+++ 2013-01-10 Notes

   * How does the DOI server work?
   * How does the Solr indexer work?

---+++ 2012-11-02 Notes

   * get to run on VM
      * SVN checkout
      * install maven: sudo apt-get install maven2
      * (potentially install JDK)
      * mvn dependency:resolve (don't forget to use an appropriate settings.xml for accessing DKPro resources)
   * What are Seersuite clusters for?
   * Presentation:
      * (Short intro into Seersuite) already known
      * Seersuite architecture: quick intro
      * Annotated Bibliography considered known
      * What did I need to do for implementing Keyphrases?
      * Talk: 20 min - Discussion: 10 min

---+++ 2012-10-26 Notes

   * get to run on virtual machine

---++++ Questions

   * UKP-specific header for source code?
      * copy from DKPro classes
   * web interface necessary for generating Keywords? *NO*
   * Perhaps disintegrate keyphrase generation from citeseerx? *NO*
   * Keyphrases -> semi-automatic tagging? *Later*
   * How to access seersuite.ukp...
   * May we omit solrTable and solrAlgorithm?

---+++ 2012-08-31 Notes

   * Read annotated_bibliography
   * "Clustered Documents": purpose?

---++++ Done

   * Test jars (located at public-ext-releases-local):
      * com.nexus.kaptcha:kaptcha:2.0
      * org.archive.crawler:heritrix:1.14.2
      * de.nava.informa:informa:0.6.5

---+++ 2012-08-10 Notes

---++++ Mid-term goals (Use Cases)
   *  As a researcher, I want to semiautomatically tag documents which have not been tagged manually, yet.
      * The application provides a set of proposed tags, derived by determining a suitable cluster for the given document.
      * I may add custom tags.
   * As a researcher, I want to see proposed documents when I select a specific document.
      * Proposed documents a somewhat similar to the current document, i.e., they belong to the same cluster and/or have a small distance to it.
   * As a researcher, I want to see a visualization of the cluster of the current document
      * The visualization may be integrated in a similar fashion like the Citegraph.

---++++ Outstanding Tasks
   1 Examine how Algorithm/Table search may be replaced with domain-specific search (-> HowTo)
   1 Preparations for adding categories to documents
      * Find appropriate integration into DB (represent hierarchy of categories)
      * Which new DAOs are required? 
      * Write HowTo on how to add new SQL queries to the system
      * explore how cluster visualization may be integrated (like Citegraph)
      * design database/table (Foreign keys?) -> SQL script
      * create sample data or wait for Clemens
   1 _low priority_ Get MyCiteseer to run (locally)
      * contact Yevgen for information on that 
   1 SVN repository
      * check in current version
      * test checked-in version on another PC
      * write HowTo for local customization (e.g. scripts...) 
      * script for localizing repository locations (applicationContext-csx-jdbc.xml)
   1 Seersuite<->DKPro
      * How to integrate DKPro functionality into Seersuite (design)
   1 Reverse engineer database
      * landscape view of tables and relationships (Wolfgang?)

---++++ Done Tasks
