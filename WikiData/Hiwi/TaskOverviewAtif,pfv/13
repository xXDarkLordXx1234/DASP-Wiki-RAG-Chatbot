| reading about UIMA from different websites,  | 16-01-2007 | 5 | UIMA seemed very useful and intresting to me |
| understanding UIMA , its different parts AE, CAS,multiple view , multimodel supprot , collection processing etc. | 17-01-2007 | 6  |  |
| Installation of UIMA and EMF to use with eclipse. and running the examples codes of UIMA. | 29-01-2007 | 10  |  |
| using UIMA and EMF with eclipse to run a project which gathers useful information from a descriptive text file. | 30-01-2007 | 10  | Well one has to set up a lot of things e.g file descirptor, make the annotator and assign the annotator to the analysis engine  before writing the class to actually get the data using the prevoius classes , but it was in the end quite easy and flexible to handle the data. This turorial is very gud for beginners of UIMA like me.  |
| (Task Continued) to run a project which gathers useful information from a descriptive text file. | 31-01-2007 | 5  |  |

| running the parser thorugh java using external process | 22-03-2007 | 6 | I was able to run the bitpar through java class , gives all the information aboutt the command ,the errors etc but wasnt able to find a way to give input arguments through shell to the command in java |
| give input arguments to the bitpar through java | 23-03-2004 | 5 | not successful even now , may be try to use threading next time to do this |
| input arguments tried with threading this time | 26-03-2005 | 5 | input arguments to the process thorugh java , so far getting errors |
