| using UIMA and EMF with eclipse to run a project which gathers useful information from a descriptive text file. | 30-01-2007 | 10 hours | Well one has to set up a lot of things e.g file descirptor, make the annotator and assign the annotator to the analysis engine  before writing the class to actually get the data using the prevoius classes , but it was in the end quite easy and flexible to handle the data. This turorial is very gud for beginners of UIMA like me.  |
