---+ JWPL DBMapping Tool
</b></center>
---++ Functionalities:

- The DBMapping Tool performs the mapping of Wikipedia dumps to dumps for the JWPL.

- The DBMapping Tool is able to extract multiple dump versions (as JWPL dumps) from the input dumps starting from a given 'from' timestamp and ending with a given 'to' timestamp using regular intervals (in days) between them.

- The DBMapping Tool performs the transformation of xml-files to sql-files using the mwdumper.

- The DBMapping Tool is also able to extract txt-dumps (for mysql) from sql-dumps. However only the functions RAND() and&nbsp; <font color="#000000"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><font size="3">DATE_ADD('1970-01-01', INTERVAL UNIX_TIMESTAMP() SECOND)+0</font></font></font> are supported.

&nbsp;&nbsp; The DBMapping&nbsp;Tool is the unique java programm (plattform independent) that performs this task.

- The DBMapping Tool performs the extraction of 'gz' and 'bz2' files.
