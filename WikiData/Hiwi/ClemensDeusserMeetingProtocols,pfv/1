Informal meeting with Wolfgang.
   * Discussed the role of DKPro in the thesis and the graph representation.
   * Co-occurence of keywords/phrases currently the best bet for classification, but may need a way to detect synonyms.
Tasks:
   * Think about things other than authors and generic keyphrases that could be relevant for classification.
   * Normalise distances.
   * Read Shuo's code to gain understanding of the DKPro pipeline so experimentation with various methods provided by the framework can begin.
