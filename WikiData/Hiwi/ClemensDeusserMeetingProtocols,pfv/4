Meeting with Frau Gurevych and sebsequent talk with Nicolai concerning Fachsystematik and how to use it for our problem at hand
   * Contact Frau Paulokat at DIPF and ask for an opportunity to discuss how the PEDOCS keyphrases were chosen and their correlation to the FS
   * Parse the FS with respect to main categories and subcategories and create statistics for both
   * Contact Nikolai once data is available to schedule a meeting with Oliver and Jinseok concerning already existing multi labelling approaches and implementations

Meeting with Wolfgang
   * Need to do more elaborate and more regular documentation (this wiki).
   * Talked about detailing (designing, implementing?) evaluation methods such as Cross-validation using keywords or extracted keyphrases (Nouns, verbs or more specific such as methods).
   * As a more distant goal, filter for synonyms and hypernyms. Using synonyms can help to properly classify keywords that pertain to a similar subject and can be used to weigh keywords more appropriately (currently only exact matches are weighed).

Meeting with Wolfgang
   * Determine intersection of keywords between Fachsystematik and pedocs database and enter into database.
   * Document clustering with CW.
Interlude with Chris Biemann:
   * Use tf*idf to weigh relevance of keywords.
   * Cut edges below a certain weight threshold.
   * Use CW multiple times with differing seeds to exclude anomalies.

Informal meeting with Wolfgang.
   * Discussed the role of DKPro in the thesis and the graph representation.
   * Co-occurence of keywords/phrases currently the best bet for classification, but may need a way to detect synonyms.
Tasks:
   * Think about things other than authors and generic keyphrases that could be relevant for classification.
   * Normalise distances.
   * Read Shuo's code to gain understanding of the DKPro pipeline so experimentation with various methods provided by the framework can begin.
