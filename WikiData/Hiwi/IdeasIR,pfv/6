---+++ experiments
   * run (without fields) just DN to see if wrong POS annotations make a difference (baseline <-> DT expansions)
   * run just N (narrative) and see, if expansions on this improve performance
   * add another term selecting method: by least key count (in the DT)

---+++ written thesis
   * TWSI: conduct statistics for the 1016 nouns in the topics and documents
   * explain BM25 in IR introduction (refer Gottron)
