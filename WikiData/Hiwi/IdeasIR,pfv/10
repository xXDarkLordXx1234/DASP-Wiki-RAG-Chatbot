---+++ experiments
   * run (without fields) just DN to see if wrong POS annotations make a difference (baseline <-> DT expansions)
   * run just N (narrative) and see, if expansions on that improve performance (why? no NNP mistagging)
   * add another term selecting method: by least key count (in the DT)

---+++ written thesis
   * UIMA intro: sketch full pipeline (reader, annotators, consumer)
   * TWSI: conduct statistics for the 1016 nouns in the topics and documents
   * intro: show an example sentence expanded with all the three resources
   * intro:TWSI: How are polysemous/monosemous target words identified? What features are used?
   * intro: sketch "IR pipeline" (information need, query-docs matching, results)
   * DT: point out the notion of the DT being able to deal with misspellings in a certain way (as long as they are available in the texts it is built from)
