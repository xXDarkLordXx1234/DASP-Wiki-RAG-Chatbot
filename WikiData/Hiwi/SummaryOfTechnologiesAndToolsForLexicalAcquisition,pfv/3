---+++Summary of Technologies and Tools for Lexical Acquisition (PANACEA D6.1)

   * Four main areas of lexical acquisition are included: Subcategorization frames (SCFs), Selectional Preferences (SPs), Lexical-semantic Classes (LCs), for both nouns and verbs, and Multi-Word Expressions (MWEs).
   * "By lexical merging, or merging of dictionaries, we refer to the process of composing a new lexicon out of two or more existing lexica...."
   * LMF standard is mentioned as a potential data model
      * section 5: Resource Building: "not all of the lexical acquisition tasks investigated during the project will necessarily result in a PANACEA fully-integrated component ... For the tasks and languages resulting in a fully-integrated component, the results of the lexical acquisition components will be encoded in XML and, where possible, will be *compliant to the LMF standard*."
      * section 7 Work Plan, Lexical Merging: "...As for the formats, we envision the use of automatic components that performs conversions to and from *LMF* ( *or a yet to be investigated ad-hoc internal format*) both in the input layer and in the output layer. "
   * section 6.1 Current Techniques: lists related work on lexicon merging

[[%ATTACHURL%/crouch-king-unifyingResources.pdf][crouch-king-unifyingResources.pdf]]: 
         * work by XEROX Parc researchers
         * describes work on merging XLE syntactic lexicon (developed as part of the broad-coverage English LFG grammar for the !ParGram project), !WordNet, Cyc, and !VerbNet 
         * building a Unified Lexicon (UL) with lexical entries for verbs based on their syntactic subcategorization in combination with their meaning
         * part of the goal of building the UL is to understand where gaps in information arise across the merged resources
