---++++Standardisation Action Plan for CLARIN: the role of LMF

   * LMF is listed among ongoing standardisation projects (section 3)
   * more specifically, "LMF is fairly new and yet not enough realistic tests have been carried out to speak about a well-proven standard"
   * but: "LMF has been widely standardized and first tools are supporting this standard"
