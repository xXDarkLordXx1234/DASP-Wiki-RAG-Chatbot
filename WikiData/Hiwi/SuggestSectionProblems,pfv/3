---+ Suggest Section Problems

*1) Character convertation problems* <verbatim>(for example plainText: ' -> wikiText: &rsquo;)</verbatim>

Example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _PlainText:_   <verbatim>I wasn't at all sure it was going to work.(insert) But I'm happy to say</verbatim>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _WikiText:_ <verbatim>I wasn&rsquo;t at all sure it was going to work. But I&rsquo;m happy to say</verbatim>

     

Solution: increase threshold

*2) To much html tags in wiki text*

Example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _PlainText:_ <verbatim>I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.(insert) I had two</verbatim>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _WikiText:_ <verbatim>I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.<br /><br />I had two</verbatim>

Solution: increase surrounding text length and threshold

*3) TODO: False insertion in html tags*

Example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _PlainText:_ <verbatim>I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.(insert) I had two</verbatim>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _WikiText:_ <verbatim>I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.<br /><br />I had two</verbatim>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _AfterInsertion(WikiText)_ :
<verbatim>
I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.<
