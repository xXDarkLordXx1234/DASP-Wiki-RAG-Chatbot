---+ Suggest Section Problems

*1) Character convertation problems* (for example plainText: <verbatim>'</verbatim> -&gt; wikiText:<verbatim>&rsquo;</verbatim>)

Example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _PlainText:_   <verbatim>I wasn't at all sure it was going to work.(insert) But I'm happy to say</verbatim>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _WikiText:_ <verbatim>I wasn&rsquo;t at all sure it was going to work. But I&rsquo;m happy to say</verbatim>

     

Solution: increase threshold

*2) To much html tags in wiki text*

Example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _PlainText:_ I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.(insert) I had two

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _WikiText:_ I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.<br /><br />I had two

Solution: increase surrounding text length and threshold

*3) TODO: False insertion in html tags*

Example:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PlainText: I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.(insert) I had two

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WikiText: I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.<br /><br />I had two

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AfterInsertion(WikiText):

I realized that I was finally in a position to try to do it.&lt;
