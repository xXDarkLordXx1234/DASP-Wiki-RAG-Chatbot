---++FrameNet Relations
   * In !FrameNet, eight different relations between frames are defined
   * Every relation is directed, which means that there are different names for the two ends of relations.
   * The following table provides an overview on the different frame relations and how the elements of the relations are called

---++++++ Explanation
   * *Inheritance* : An IS-A relation. The child frame is a subtype of the parent frame, and each FE in the parent is bound to a corresponding FE in the child. An example is the Revenge frame which inherits from the Rewards and punishments frame.
      * The bound between FEs of two Frames connected by Inheritance Relation is not marked.
      * Quantization:
         * A frame can have from 0 up to 2 parents
         * A frame can have from 0 up to 41 children
   * 
   * *Using* : The child frame presupposes the parent frame as background, e.g the Speed frame uses
(or presupposes) the Motion frame; however, not all parent FEs need to be bound to child FEs.
