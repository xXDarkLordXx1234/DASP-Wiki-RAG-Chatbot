---++ !FrameNet Relations
   * In !FrameNet, nine different relations between frames are defined
   * Every relation is directed, which means that there are different names for the two ends of relations.
   * The following table provides an overview on the different frame relations, their IDs, and how the elements of the relations are called

---++++++ Explanation
   * *Inheritance* : An IS-A relation. The child frame is a subtype of the parent frame, and each FE in the parent is bound to a corresponding FE in the child. An example is the _Revenge_ frame which inherits from the _Rewards and punishments_ frame.
      * The bound between FEs of two Frames connected by Inheritance Relation is not marked.
      * FEs connected by Inheritance Relation don't always share the same name, but they always share the same Sematic Type
      * Quantization:
         * A frame can have from 0 up to 2 parents
         * A frame can have from 0 up to 41 children
   * *Subframe*: The child frame is a subevent of a complex event represented by the parent, e.g. the _Criminal process_ frame has subframes of _Arrest_, _Arraignment_, _Trial_, and _Sentencing_.
      * Quantization:
         * A frame can have up to 11 subframes
         * A frame can be a subframe of up to 2 frames
   * *Using*: The child frame presupposes the parent frame as background, e.g the _Accuracy_ frame uses (or presupposes) the frames _Measurable attributes_ and _Success or failure_; however, not all parent FEs need to be bound to child FEs.
      *  Quantization:
         * A frame can use up to 3 parents
         * A frame can be used in up to 30 children
   * *See_also*: In cases where there are groups of frames which are similar and should be carefully differentiated, compared,and contrasted, each of the frames in question has a !SeeAlso relation with a representative member of the group.
      * This relationship does not imply any particular relationship between the Frame Elements or subframesof the frames involved.
      * Quantization:
         * A frame can refer to only one Main Entry
         * A Main Entry can be referred to from up to 4 frames
   * *ReFraming_Mapping* - Its not uncommon for lexical units to be moved into new frames. This frame relation remaps the names of FEs from one frame to another when frame boundaries have changed (Petruck et al., 2004). For example the _Forging_ frame (containing verbs such as _falsify_, _fake_, and _counterfeit_) is related via the !ReFraming_Mapping frame relation to the _Feigning_ frame (which contains separate lexical units for some of the same verbs plus others for verbs such as _affect_ and _pretend_). _Taken from [[http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=5&ved=0CDEQFjAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.163.5839%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&rct=j&q=ReFraming_Mapping%20frameNEt&ei=nTLpTK7GK8_DswbW4JXICw&usg=AFQjCNEP_eXEIa-dyLyZwlqty21cO8h40Q&cad=rja][Meaning-Text-Theory and Lexical Frames, Bob Coyne and Owen Rambow]]_

   * *Causative_of*: Is a Relation between a Stative parent frame which is "caused" by a Frame that inherits from _Transitive action_ frame. For example the frame _Silencing_ is the Causative of the frame _Become silent_.
      * Quantization:
         * A frame can be Causative or Stative of one frame
   * *Precedes*: This relation occurs only between two Component frames of a single Complex frame, i.e. as extra information associated with a set of Subframe relations. It specifies the sequence of states and events that are definitional for a certain state-of-affairs. E.g. the frame _Departing_ precedes the frame _Arriving_ both frames are Components of the frame Traversing.
      * A frame can precede up to 3 frames
      * A frame can be preceded by up to 2 frames
   * *Inchoative_of*: Is a Relation between a Stative parent frame which is "caused" by an Inchoative child frame. For example the frame _Coming to belive_ is an Inchoative of the frame _Awareness_.
      * Inchoative frames inherit from Frames: _Event_, _State_ or _Gradable attributes_
      * Quantization:
         * A frame can be Inchoative or Stative of one frame
   * *Perspective on*: The child frame provides a particular perspective on an un-perspectivized parent frame. A pair of examples consists of the _Hiring_ and _Get a job_ frames, which perspectivize the _Employment_ start frame from the Employers and the Employees point of view, respectively.
      * Quantization:
         * A frame can have a perspective on no more than one frame.
         * A frame can be perspectivized in up to 4 frames
