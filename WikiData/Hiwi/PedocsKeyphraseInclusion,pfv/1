     This chart splits the inclusion ratio into intervals ([0%, 5%], (5%, 10%], ..., (95%, 100%]), and shows how many documents of the German corpus are in each ratio interval. <p>
     *Example:* <ul><li>The rightmost column shows, that there are over 400 documents whose keyphrase inclusion ratios are between 95% (exclusive) and 100% (inclusive).</li><li>The column above "50" shows, that there are almost 200 documents whose keyphrase inclusion ratios are between 45% (exclusive) and 50% (inclusive).</li></ul>

   * *Document Minimal Inclusion Ratio:* <p>
     <img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/../ShuoYangKeyphrases/min_ratio.png" alt="min_ratio.png" width="500" height="300" /><p>
     This chart shows for each inclusion ratio interval, what percentage of documents have _at least_ such an inclusion ratio.<p>
     *Example:* <ul><li>The leftmost point shows, that 100% of the documents - all documents - have at least 0% (inclusive) inclusion ratio</li>
      <li>The point above "55" shows, that more than 80% of the documents have at least 55% (inclusive) inclusion ratio</li></ul>
