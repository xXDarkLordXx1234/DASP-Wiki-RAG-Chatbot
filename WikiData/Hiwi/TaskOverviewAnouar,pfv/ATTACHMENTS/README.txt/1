1.MediaWiki input files:
The MediaWiki input files must have the following names:
- page.txt
- text.txt
- revision.txt
- pagelinks.sql
- categorylinks.sql

The files page.txt, text.txt and revision.txt are obtained by unzipping 
the file <language>-yyyymmdd-pages-meta-history.xml.bz2 using xml2sql for 
example.
The file pagelinks.sql is obtained after unzipping the file 
<language>-yyyymmdd-pagelinks.sql.bz and removing the prefix of the file.
The file categorylinks.sql is obtained after unzipping the file
<language>-yyyymmdd-categorylinks.sql.bz and removing the prefix of the file.

2.JWPL database output files:
The files that are generated by this programm are:
- Page.txt
- page_categories
- page_inlinks
- page_outlinks
- page_redirects
- PageMapLine
- Category
- category_pages
- category_inlinks
- category_outlinks
- MetaData

3.Timestamp for the wished version:
Please use a String representation of the timestamp with 14 digits.
Example: 20071010134223 => October, 10th 2007 13h42'23''
Usually the timestamps have 000000 as suffix, example 20071423000000.

4.Metadata:
Please specify the language as defined in the enumeration of the JWPL.
Examples: "english","german","frensh" ...
The parameter id is the id of the current wikipedia in the MetaData table.

5.Correctness:
The obtained dump for the JWPL database to the specified timestamp is nearly 
identical with the 'direct'(explicit) dump of that wikipedia. There is generally
less than 1% of missing categories and pages due to the deletion of items.
There are no backup sources for deleted articles and categories.

6.Performance:
This software has a linear performance. There are no loops when processing tables.
