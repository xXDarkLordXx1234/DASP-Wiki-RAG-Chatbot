---+ !!Wireless Network Service

UKP does not offer a wireless network. Wireless network access is possible via the the HRZ, either with a TU-ID or with an external eduroam account. For more information please refer to the [[http://www.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/netz/vpn_wlan/wlan_2/eduroam.de.jsp][HRZ documentation]].

To access UKP-internal services after connecting to the HRZ wireless network, you have to open a [[VpnService][VPN connection]] to the UKP network.
