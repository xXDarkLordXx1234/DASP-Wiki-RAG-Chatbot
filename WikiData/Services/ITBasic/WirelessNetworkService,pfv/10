---+ !!Wireless Network Service

UKP does not offer a wireless network. Wireless network access is possible via the the HRZ, either with a TU-ID or with an external eduroam account. For more information please refer to the [[http://www.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/netz/vpn_wlan/wlan_2/eduroam.de.jsp][HRZ documentation]]. To access UKP-internal services after connecting to the HRZ wireless network, you have to open a [[Services.VpnService][VPN connection]] to the UKP network.

(Note that the instructions provided by HRZ say that you need to point your network configuration to a Deutsche Telekom certificate in PEM format.  This didn't work for me; I had to use the CRT version of the certificate. --TM)
