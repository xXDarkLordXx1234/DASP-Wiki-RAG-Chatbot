*%RED%UKP does not offer a wireless network.%ENDCOLOR%*

Wireless network access is possible via the the HRZ, either with a TU-ID (special device wlan account is needed from 2023) or with an external eduroam account. For more information please refer to the [[https://www.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/netz/netzzugang_internet/netz_datennetz_internet_wlan_1/index.en.jsp][HRZ documentation]]. To access UKP-internal services after connecting to the HRZ wireless network, you have to open a [[Services/Lab.VpnService][VPN connection]] to the UKP network.

Notes:
   * HRZ also offers the possibility to create temporary eduroam guest accounts. Follow the HRZ documentation link from above.
   * TM: Note that the instructions provided by HRZ say that you need to point your network configuration to a Deutsche Telekom certificate in PEM format.  This didn't work for me; I had to use the CRT version of the certificate.
