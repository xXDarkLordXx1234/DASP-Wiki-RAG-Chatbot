---+ Change password
   * Two options:
      * Change it via the dedicated [[https://pwchange.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de][password change webpage]].
      * Or at your (linux) workstation, simply use the =passwd= command on the command line.
      * For Windows you can also use STRG + ALT + DEL and select change password
   * It might take several minutes until all machines and services accept the new password. Please be patient.
   * *Please note:* We recommend doing so while beeing in the office network to make sure the sync / cache gets updated faster. Otherwise your working device password might not get updated successfully.
      <!--* Alternatively log in via ssh to any of our compute servers and use =passwd= on the command line there-->
