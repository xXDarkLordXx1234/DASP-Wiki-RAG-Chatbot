---++ *%BLACK%Slurm Compute Cluster FAQ - other labs special%ENDCOLOR%*

---++ First steps
---+++ How do I know if i'm "ATHENE only"?
   * You can check which accounts you have been assigned with =sshare -U= executed on the login node, your username should be only present at lines starting with =athene-= 
   * If you are also part uf a =ukp-= group, consider going back to [[/Services/ITBasic/ComputeCluster][the computer cluster faq]].

---++ ATHENE only special setup
---+++ Storage
   * *LOCATION*: Your storage path to use / specify is =/storage/athene/work/$USERNAME=
   * *QUOTA*: There is a soft quota of 10TB / hard quota of 15TB diskspace per user. The grace period is one week. If usage is not reduced to a level below the soft limit during that time, the quota system interprets the soft limit as the hard limit and no further allocation is allowed. 

---+++ Compute-nodes
%INCLUDE{ "Services/ITBasic.ComputeClusterGPUs" pattern="---\+\+\+ Detailed Node Information(.*?)---\+\+\+" }%

The following compute-nodes are ATHENE exclusive:

%INCLUDE{ "Services/ITBasic.ComputeClusterGPUs" pattern="---\+\+\+\+ ATHENE compute-nodes(.*?)---\+\+\+" }%

---+++ Running Jobs
---++++ Example 1
   * <u>If you are researcher and associated ONLY with ATHENE and not UKP</u>, you would want to specify the partition "gpu-athene" (selecting the compute-nodes) and the account "athene-researcher" (your "piggy bank") e.g. like 
   * <verbatim>sbatch -p gpu-athene -a athene-researcher your_script.sh</verbatim> 
   * to submit your jobs. You can also put these values to your sbatch script (see below for an exmaple for your_script.sh)
   * *Explanation:* 
      * There is no need to specify the qos, as "gpu" is the default qos for account athene-researcher

---+++ Example Sbatch File
   * This is an example file to fun a basic GPU job as athene researcher
   * Values need / can be adapted based on [[/Services/ITBasic/ComputeCluster#Quota_44_Accounts_44_Partitions_and_Resources][account, partition, qos and resource limits]] / resurce requirements.
   * This script can be run like =sbatch your_script.sh= after personalisation.
   * *Remember*: You "pay" with your [[/Services/ITBasic/ComputeCluster#FairShare][fairshare]] in your account ("piggybank") for every resource you request and use!
   * <verbatim>#!/bin/bash

# The "#" before the "SBATCH" parameters do not comment it out! Use triple "###" to comment something out.

# Limit runtime d-hh:mm:ss - here limited to 1min
#SBATCH --time=0-00:01:00
#
# PARTITION to run in (athene-only people need to specify partition "gpu-athene" - otherwise the default "gpu" partition, which can only be used by UKP members, is selected leading to errors during job submission!)
#SBATCH --partition=gpu-athene
#
# ACCOUNT to use (default account for athene-only people is "athene-researcher" and therefore does not need to be specified - check your accounts with command: "sshare -U")
###SBATCH --account=athene-researcher

# QOS to use (default QOS for everyone is "gpu" and therefore does not need to be specified)
