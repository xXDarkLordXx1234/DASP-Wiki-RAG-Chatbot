---+!! Slurm Compute Cluster FAQ

%TOC%

---++ Jobs and scheduling

---+++ What's the status of my jobs?
Run:
<verbatim>
squeue --u $USER
</verbatim>

For more monitoring commands, see e.g. [[https://hpcf.umbc.edu/general-productivity/tools-for-monitoring-your-jobs/][here.]]

---+++ Why is my job pending?
Check the REASON column of the =squeue= output.
   * "Resources" means that there is currently no free compute node with the resource requirements of your job.
   * "Priority" means that other jobs in the same partition have a higher priority than yours.
   * For other codes, check [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html#lbAF][the Slurm documentation]].

You can increase your chances by:
   * Requesting fewer resources (CPUs, GPUs, Memory).
   * Using the =--time= option of =sbatch= to limit the execution time of your jobs.
   * Using an account with higher !FairShare, if you have multiple accounts at your disposal.

---+++ How much !FairShare do I have left?
%INCLUDE{"ComputeClusterDetermineFairShare"}%

---+++ Why does my job fail immediately? It's running fine on my workstation.

Please check the following:
   * Do the parent folders of the =--output= and =--error= files in your =sbatch= script *exist* and do you have *write permissions* for these files?
   * Does your experiment try to read to or write from =/home/&lt;user&gt;/...=? There are no =/home= directories on compute nodes in our cluster. Configure your experiment to use =/ukp-storage-1= instead of =/home=. Well-written external code libraries should offer the possibility to change their working directory, too. If you are using python and your script still does not run, try adding =/ukp-storage-1= to your =PYTHONPATH=.

---+++ How do I kill a compute job?

To cancel a job, use =scancel=. You need the running or pending jobid. It is only the job's owner and SLURM administrators that can cancel jobs.

<verbatim>
scancel <jobid>
</verbatim>

To cancel all your jobs (running and pending) you can run

<verbatim>
scancel -u $USER
</verbatim>

You get the job id when you submit the job and you can look it up by =squeue -u <username>=. Interactive jobs are cancelled once you close the session, e.g. via =Ctrl + C=.

---+++ How to schedule jobs which make use of GPUs?
---++++ Simple option via the =--gres= parameter
You can use the =--gres= option of =sbatch= or =srun=. For example, use =--gres=gpu:p100:2= to request two P100 GPUs. If the GPU model is not of importance, you can also use =--gres=gpu:1= to request one GPU of any model available. For details, refer to [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html][the sbatch documentation]].

---++++ Advanced option via node features
More advanced GPU requests are possible via node feature constraints. For example, you can force a job to run on a GPU with 16GB or 24GB memory by running
<verbatim>
sbatch --constraint=gpu_mem:16GB|gpu_mem:24GB
</verbatim>
AND and OR constraints and more are possible, see [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html][the sbatch documentation]]. Note that features are *predefined, plain strings*, so querying for 13.42GB of GPU memory will not work. See [[ComputeClusterFAQ#Which_nodes_are_there_63_Which_GPUs_are_there_63][this FAQ question]] for which features are available.

---+++ How do I run jobs that run longer than three days?

Researchers can submit jobs taking up to seven days by using the "snail" QOS. This can be done by adding =--qos=snail= as an option for =sbatch=.

---+++ How to run many similar jobs efficiently?

Slurm offers [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/job_array.html][job arrays]] for starting many jobs with similar resource and runtime requirements. Example applications are hyperparameter optimization, running your code on many different datasets, and more. Benefits of using job arrays over starting individual jobs:
   * easier management: array jobs can be cancelled all at once, have their resource requirements updated all at once, etc.
   * less pollution in =squeue=
   * it's more efficient for the Slurm scheduler

When submitting a job array, Slurm provides additional environment variables for each job (see the official documentation linked above). Check the development section of these FAQ for hints on how to use these environment variables effectively.

---++ Storage

---+++ Where to put code and data?

See [[ComputeClusterStorage]].

---+++ I need fast temporary storage for my job, where can I get that?

Some of the nodes in the cluster have a local disk space for storing temporary files. When a job starts on such a node, a directory for temporary files is automatically created. The location of this directory is passed to your script in the =TMPDIR= environment variable. Note that *all files in this directory are automatically deleted after your job completes or fails.*

You can specifically request nodes with temporary storage by using the =--tmp=<size[units]>= option of sbatch/srun, for example =--tmp=1G= for 1GB.

---++ Cluster information

---+++ Which partitions (== queues) are there?
Run:
<verbatim>
scontrol show partition
</verbatim>

---+++ Which nodes are there? Which GPUs are there?

The following command lists all nodes in the cluster alongside their number of CPUs, their RAM, GPUs and features:
<verbatim>
sinfo --format="%20n %8t %8c %10m %25G %100f"
</verbatim>

As of 2019, the following GPU models are used throughout the cluster:
| *Name*   | *GPU architecture* | *GFLOPS* | *VRAM (!GiB)* |
| v100     | volta              |  7014    |           32 |
| p100     | pascal             |  4353    |           16 |
| k40      | kepler             |  1555    |           12 |
| titanrtx | turing             |   449.28 |           24 |
| titanxp  | pascal             |   346.2  |           12 |
| titanx   | pascal             |   330.15 |           12 |

For *live monitoring of nodes*, refer to [[ComputeClusterFAQ#How_can_I_see_monitoring_information_of_the_Slurm_cluster_63][this part of the FAQ]].

---+++ How can I see monitoring information of the Slurm cluster?

Information about the load and health of the cluster is shown at [[http://monitoring.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de]].

---+++ Which possibilities are there for testing/debugging an experiment?

---++++ Use the "testing" partition
If you want to quickly check whether your code works on Slurm, submit it to the =testing= partition via
<verbatim>
sbatch -p testing myscript.sh
</verbatim>
The maximum runtime for jobs in this partition in 15 minutes to ensure short queueing times during debugging / development.

---++++ Start an interactive shell
If you want to have an interactive shell on a slurm node, then on *wormulon*, you can run

<verbatim>
srun --pty bash -i
</verbatim>

There, you can open a python shell or start parts of your experiment to see if everything runs as expected. =srun= accepts the same parameters as you can specify in a batch file, e.g. =srun --gres=gpu:1 --pty bash= would request one GPU.

---++++ Live monitoring of stdout/stderr
If you use =srun= inside your =sbatch= bashscript to start your main experiment (as in "srun python run.py"), then you can monitor stdout/stderr output while the job is running via:
<verbatim>
sattach <jobid.stepid>
</verbatim>
=stepid= will be 0 unless your bash script contains multiple =srun= calls. For example, to see the output of the first =srun= call within job 42, run =sattach 42.0=.

---++++ Remote Debugging
This option is much more powerful but also takes more effort to set up. The !PyCharm debugger will run on your workstation but will debug code that is running remotely on a Slurm compute node. This way, one can interactively debug code using GPUs and more.

*Setup instructions*: You need !PyCharm Professional. As of 2019-07, there are free 1 year licenses for students, see https://www.jetbrains.com/student/. Then, follow the [[https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/remote-debugging-with-product.html][instructions for remote debugging]].
If you are having trouble, MB has used it before and might be able to help.

According to their website, Visual Studio is also capable of remote debugging.

---+++ How can I access Slurm job information (job ID, executing node, ...) from within my experiment?

---++++ Via sbatch filename patterns
You can use placeholders in sbatch arguments to vary filenames depending on the job id and more. The following example would include the jobid and the name of the executing node in the filename:
<verbatim>
#SBATCH --output=/ukp-storage-1/my_user/myjob.%j.%N.out
</verbatim>
A list of all possible placeholders can be found in the [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html][sbatch documentation]].

---++++ Via slurm environment variables
Slurm sets environment variables for the job ID, the executing node, the resources of the current node and more. An full list is shown [[https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#lbAJ][here]].

You can use these environment variables directly inside your =sbatch= bashscript to load certain datasets or pass certain parameters to your code.
*If you use python*, check out *[[https://pypi.org/project/slurmee/][the slurmee package]]*. It conveniently provides Slurm job information inside python à la =slurmee.get_job_id()=.

---+++ How can I create a virtualenv?

Use the =venv= module that comes with Python, e.g. 

<verbatim>
python3.6 -m venv venv
</verbatim>

Replace =python3.6= with the Python version of your choice. In your batch file, you can activate it by referencing its absolute path, e.g. =source /ukp-storage-1/$your_name/test/venv/bin/activate=

---+++ How can I use Python 3.7+?

Use [[https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html][miniconda]].

---+++ How can I use a specific CUDA version?

In your batch script, use <verbatim>module load cuda</verbatim> for the newest version or =module load cuda/$version=. Currently installed are

<verbatim>
cuda/10.1 (default)
cuda/10.0
cuda/9.2
cuda/9.1
cuda/9.0
cuda/8.0-ga2
cuda/8.0
</verbatim>

---+++ How can I use tensorboard with Slurm?
Use [[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-file-systems-over-ssh][sshfs]] and run tensorboard on your workstation.

On your workstation, run something like:
<verbatim>
mkdir ~/ukp-storage-1
sshfs <username>@wormulon:/ukp-storage-1/<username> ~/ukp-storage-1
tensorboard --logdir ~/ukp-storage-1/my-experiment
</verbatim>

---++ My issue isn't listed here
If you are a student, please contact your supervisor. Otherwise please post a bug [[https://bugzilla.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/enter_bug.cgi?product=Shared-IT&component=Slurm][on bugzilla]].
