Check your current !FairShare by running =sshare -U=.
| *FairShare* | *Interpretation* |
| 1.0 | Underserviced: Account has not used the cluster at all recently. |
| 0.5 | The account has used exactly the amount of resources it was granted. |
| 0.0 | Overserviced: The account has used up its quota. Jobs can still be submitted, but with potentially long queueing times. |
