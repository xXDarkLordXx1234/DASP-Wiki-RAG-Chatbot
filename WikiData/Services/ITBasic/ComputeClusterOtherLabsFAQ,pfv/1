---++ First steps
---+++ Basic information
   * TBD
---+++ Getting access
   * TBD

---++ Special "external labs" Features
---+++ Storage
   * If you are ATHENE only (and not a member / student of UKP lab) your storage path is /storage/athene/work/$USERNAME
---+++ Compute-nodes

%INCLUDE{ "Services.Campus.ComputeClusterGPUs" pattern="---\+\+\+ Detailed Node Information(.*?)---\+\+\+" }%

The following compute-nodes are ATHENE exclusive:

---+++ Running Jobs
---++++ Example 1
   * <u>If you are researcher and associated ONLY with ATHENE and not UKP</u>, you would want to specify the partition "gpu-athene" (selecting the compute-nodes) and the account "athene-researcher" (your "piggy bank") e.g. like <verbatim>sbatch -p gpu-athene -a athene-researcher your_script.sh</verbatim> to submit your jobs. You can also put these values to your sbatch script. 
   * *Explanation:* 
      * There is no need to specify the qos, as "gpu" is the default qos for account athene-researcher
      * But might need to specify the account using =-a athene-researcher= to use the correct account if you have been assigned multiple ones (remember to check your accounts using =sshare -U=)
