---+!! Accounts Explained

---++ Accounts Overview
   * *UKP Account:* 
      * UKP maintains its own user database in addition to the TU ID you got from the HRZ / TU Darmstadt. 
      * All services <u>hosted at UKP Lab like wiki, messenger, laptop login, SLURM,</u> ... use the UKP account (mostly your surname)
      * Usually the account will be closed on your last working day if not stated otherwise in the exit WF.
   * *TU-ID:* 
      * Centrally hosted services of TU Darmstadt use the TU ID (mostly a letter / digit combination like sa12egal). 
      * Used for <u>E-Mail, Services managed via SSO (single sign on), Hessenbox, IDM System,</u> ..
      * Usually the account becomes invalid a few weeks after your contract at TU Darmstadt ends. 
   * Cloud ID: 
      * Used to activate Office Licences, usually yourtuid@tu-darmstadt.de (like sa12egal@tu-darmstadt.de)

---++ Issues with accounts
   * If you have issues with your own account, please open up a ticket. 

---++ Student accounts
   * Student accounts are only active for a limited time, mostly for the duration of the contract or during the thesis, so you have to request an extension if something changes here. 
   * But no worries, you'll receive an automated notification 2 weeks before an account who you supervise expires. 

---++ Entry Workflow
   * For every account system-admin and office-admin need the filled out entry workflow. 

---++ Exit Workflow
   * The exit workflow is a checklist to fill out if someone leaves - if you don't want that we just delete potentially important data, fill out the form.
