---+++ How to use the UKP ticket system

Also, please follow these simple guidelines when reporting a bug:

   1 Please choose a _clear and concise subject line_ , so we can immediately get an idea what is wrong
   1 _Describe your problem_ precisely to the best of your knowledge, _so we can reproduce it_ . "X doesn't work" is usually *not* enough.
   1 If you already tried something to solve it yourself, or you have an idea what could be wrong (e.g. because you changed something), it helps saving time if you tell us.
   1 If it seems appropriate, _provide additional information_ like error messages etc., but *DON'T* just copy and paste them without further explanation. 
   1 Also, *DON'T* just forward mails that might or might not relate to the problem. Take the time to formulate the problem and include only what is necessary into the email. The more precisely you formulate the problem, the quicker we will be able to solve it.

After the bug is reported, rest assured that we will take care of it as soon as we can. Sometimes other problems have a higher priority, but no ticket will be lost. So please don't report the same bug twice or ask about the status of your problem over and over again since this slows everything down; we will notify you once your problem is solved or, most often, you will know anyway.
