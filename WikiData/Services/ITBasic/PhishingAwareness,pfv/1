---++ How to Check if an Email is Valid?

### Tips for Identifying Valid Emails:

   1. **Sender's Email Address**: Verify the sender's email address. Pay close attention to misspellings or unusual domain names that may indicate phishing attempts.
   2. **Grammar and Spelling**: Legitimate emails usually have proper grammar and spelling. Be cautious of emails with numerous grammatical errors or unusual language.
   3. **Request for Personal Information**: Exercise caution if an email requests sensitive information or asks you to click on suspicious links.
   4. **Check Links and Attachments**: Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking. Avoid downloading attachments from unknown sources.
   5. **Contact the Sender**: If in doubt, contact the purported sender through alternative means (e.g., phone call, ukp messenger, going to their office) to verify the authenticity of the email.

### How to Check Email Headers in Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Web App (OWA):

   1. **Open the Suspicious Email**: Open the email that appears suspicious or potentially phishing.
   2. **View Message Options**: 
      * In Microsoft Outlook: Double-click on the email so it opens in another window, then select "File" and the click last button "Message Options."
      * In Outlook Web App (OWA): Right-click a single email message, then select "View message details." 
   3. **Check the Internet Headers**:
      * In Microsoft Outlook: Locate the "Internet Headers" section, which displays the email's header information.
   4. **Analyze Header Information**:
      * Look for inconsistencies in the sender's domain and IP addresses.
      * Check for any suspicious server paths or relay servers used in the email's delivery.
   5. **Research Header Details**: 
      * Use online tools or search engines to investigate any unfamiliar IP addresses or domains found in the email headers.
      * Use e.g. google and search for the title or centens of the mail, mostly other users have reported this email already somewhere, e.g. at reddit or other online platforms
   6. **Exercise Caution**: If the email headers contain unusual or suspicious information, treat the email with caution and refrain from clicking on any links or downloading attachments.

By following these steps and scrutinizing email headers, you can better protect yourself from falling victim to phishing attacks and identify potentially malicious emails.

---++ Why Phishing and Malware Awareness is Crucial
   * **Protect Personal Information**: Awareness helps individuals recognize and avoid phishing attempts, safeguarding their sensitive data.
   * **Prevent Financial Loss**: Awareness reduces the risk of falling victim to financial scams and fraudulent activities.
   * **Maintain Data Integrity**: Understanding malware threats helps in implementing effective cybersecurity measures to protect against data breaches and system compromise.

---+++ Importance of Data Backup / UKP Storage Usage
*%RED%It's essential to avoid storing important data solely on local devices like desktops or laptops.%ENDCOLOR%* Utilizing centralized data storage provided by the lab ensures:

   * **Data Redundancy**: Our storage often includes backups, minimizing the risk of data loss due to hardware failure or malware attacks.
   * **Accessibility**: Data stored at central storage can be accessed from multiple devices, ensuring continuity in case of device failure.
   * **Enhanced Security**: Centralized storage comes with additional security measures, like restricted areas to some users our groups, safeguarding sensitive data from unauthorized access.

*%RED%See the possibilities to storage data hosted at UKP [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/view/UKP/UkpItProcesses#Data_Housekeeping_47_Storage_possibilities][at this overview]].%ENDCOLOR%*

---+++ Conclusion

Phishing and malware pose significant threats to individuals and organizations. By understanding these threats and adopting best practices such as being vigilant against phishing attempts and utilizing secure data storage solutions, we can collectively mitigate the risks associated with cybercrime.
