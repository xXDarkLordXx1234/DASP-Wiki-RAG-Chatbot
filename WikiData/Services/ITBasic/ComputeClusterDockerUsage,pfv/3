As of 2021-01, we do not offer docker anymore. No alternative is offered currently. If you are affiliated with UKP, consider requesting a Project VM to host your dockerized applications.

[[https://www.docker.com/][docker]] and [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][docker-compose]] are installed on a limited number of nodes. We give usage permission to individual users upon request. If you need access, please send us an email to =ticket@ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de=.

Docker images and volumes are saved *locally* on nodes and are not written to network-attached storage. For this reason, we recommend the following approach:
   1 Run <verbatim>sinfo -O "NodeHost,Cores,Memory,Features:100" | sed '1p;/docker/!d'</verbatim> to see all nodes which have docker installed.
   2 Pick one node which suits your jobs (for example =apu=) then run all your jobs on that node via =sbatch -w apu=
