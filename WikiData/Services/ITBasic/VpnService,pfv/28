---+ !!VPN Service

%TOC%

---+ Terms of Use

   * This page explains how to make a VPN connection into the UKP network to use the internal services.
   * Use VPN only when necessary to access UKP resources. 
   * VPN connections are limited. Disconnect when you do not need access anymore, so somebody else can use the VPN.
   * It is possible to access the Hadoop cluster nodes via VPN.
   * Also see [[PrivateHardwareUser][terms of use for private hardware]]
<!---   * *All your Internet traffic will be routed through the VPN, so make sure you really only use the VPN when you need it.* -->

---+ !OpenVPN

Since PPTP has severe security issues (see, e.g., [[http://www.heise.de/security/artikel/Der-Todesstoss-fuer-PPTP-1701365.html][here]]), we have switched to [[http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html][OpenVPN]].

---++ Client configuration

_to be done: Screencasts_
   
---+++ Windows XP / 7 / 8
   * install the respective !OpenVPN client for your OS from [[http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html][this page]]
   * download [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/ukp-vpn.ovpn][this]] file and put it into your =YOUR_OPENVPN_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY\config= folder
   * start the !OpenVPN Gui with *adminitrative user privileges* (you will need adminitrator privileges anytime you start !OpenVPN Gui, [[http://www.google.de/search?&q=openvpn+UAC][Google]] for =UAC !OpenVPN= on that problem)
   * right-click the !OpenVPN Gui icon in the task panel and =connect= (if this option in not available, you either haven't copied the .ovpn file to the right directory, or you started the !OpenVPN Gui without super user rights)
   * enter your UKP username and password and connect

---+++ Ubuntu
   * =sudo apt-get install openvpn=, =sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn=
   * =sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn restart= 
   * download [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/ukp-vpn.ovpn][this]] file and put it into your home folder
   * now, you can 
      * either start the VPN via the commandline, using ==sudo openvpn ~/ukp-vpn.ovpn==
      * or import the =ukp-vpn.ovpn= (you might have to rename it to =client.conf=) via the network-manager GUI. Note that the later seems not to work properly in Ubuntu 10.04. You might have to cut the =ukp-vpn.ovpn= into 4 files (ca_cert.pem, priv_key.pem, user_cert.pem and static_key.key containing the respective keys) and manually select these in the network manager

---+++ Mac
   * Install Tunnelblick from ==http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/DownloadsEntry?tm=2==
   * Download [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/UKP-VPN.tblk.zip][this]] file, unzip it and import the .tblk Config with a double click.

---+ PPTP VPN

<center style="font-size:200%;color:red"> *The below information refers to the old PPTP VPN, which should not be used anymore due to security reasons and will be switched  off soon!* </center>

---++ General configuration

| Server | vpn.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de (130.83.167.254) |
| Login | UKP domain account (without leading "UKP\") |
| Domain | UKP |
| Connection type | PPTP |
| Options | enable software compression, enable remote gateway |
| Requirements | working internet connection | 

---++ Notes on specific VPN clients

---+++ Graphical VPN client in Ubuntu

If you have troubles accessing the VPN configuration in your network connections, you might have to install the package =pptp-linux= first.

This is a basic UKP-VPN configuration using the graphical client in Ubuntu. If this does not work for you or you prefer to use the command-line, see below.

In Ubuntu, to create a new VPN configuration, click on your internet connection icon at the top-right of your screen, then "VPN Connections", then "Configure VPN".  This will get you to the images shown below.  After you have saved a new configuration, click on your internet connection icon again, then "VPN Connections", then select the configuration you just saved, and it will connect.

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/vpn1.png" alt="vpn" width="50%" style="max-width: 300px" />

In the Advanched tab, enable =mppe=:

<img src="%ATTACHURLPATH%/vpn2.png" alt="vpn" width="50%" style="max-width: 300px" />

---+++ Alternative Instructions: PPTP-linux

PPTP-linux is the PPTP VPN client usually used by GNU/Linux distributions, and this section shows working configuration files and instructions for it. Most graphical VPN clients (such as the ones provided by KDE and GNOME) are simply front ends to PPTP-linux, so if you can't get them to work, you can always examine what PPTP-linux configuration files they are creating, or use PPTP-linux directly.

PPTP-linux stores its connection configuration files in the directory =/etc/ppp/peers=.  Create a new file =/etc/ppp/peers/UKP= with the following contents, replacing my UKP user name with yours:

<pre>pty "pptp vpn.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de --nolaunchpppd"
name "UKP\\miller"
remotename PPTP
require-mppe-128
file /etc/ppp/options.pptp
ipparam UKP
refuse-eap
refuse-chap
defaultroute
</pre>

PPTP-linux stores the connection credentials in the file =/etc/ppp/chap-secrets=.  Create or edit this file and append the following line, replacing my UKP user name and password with yours:

<pre>UKP\\miller	PPTP	mypassword	*</pre>

<!--
PPTP-linux stores its network traffic routing configuration in the file =/etc/ppp/ip-up.d/route-traffic=.  Create or edit this file and ensure the contents are as follows, modifying the value of the =NET= and =IFACE= variables as appropriate.

<pre>#!/bin/bash
NET="10.0.0.0/8" # set me
IFACE="ppp0" # set me
#IFACE=$1
route add -net ${NET} dev ${IFACE}
</pre>
-->

Now you are ready to connect to the VPN.  Enter the following command as root:  =pppd call UKP=

If everything goes well you should see something like the following:

<pre>Using interface ppp0
Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/pts/5
CHAP authentication succeeded
MPPE 128-bit stateless compression enabled
not replacing default route to eth0 [192.168.0.1]
local  IP address 130.83.163.249
remote IP address 130.83.163.236
Script /etc/ppp/ip-up finished (pid 7020), status = 0x0</pre>

You are now connected to the VPN, but your network traffic will not be routed through it by default.  To make the VPN connection your default route for all traffic, issue the following command as root: =route add default ppp0=  This way all Internet connections originating from your machine will appear to be coming from TU Darmstadt.  This is useful if you plan to connect to websites of journals for which TU Darmstadt has a subscription.  However, it may slow down your Internet connection somewhat. If you don't need your web traffic to appear to originate from TU Darmstadt (for example, you just want to be able to connect to your desktop machine or the UKP infrastructure), then it might be better to restrict VPN routing to the TU Darmstadt network: =route add -net 130.83.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 dev ppp0=

When you are done using the VPN connection, you can simply kill the =pppd= command by pressing Ctrl+C or issuing =killall pppd=.

---++ Manual routing to UKP's 130.83.0.0 net

If you want to or have to avoid sending your entire network traffic to UKP while being connected to VPN, you can define the necessary routes manually using the following steps:

*Windows 7*
   * Open the properties pane of your UKP-VPN adapter.
   * Find the TCP/IPv4 section on the network tab and open its properties pane.
   * Click on "advanced" and remove the checkbox marker regarding the standard gateway (so far, this procedure is similar to the old TK network)
   * Now, you can only access hosts in the UKP private network (IP addresses starting with 10); desktop machines, however, have public IPs starting with 130.
   * Therefore, you need to define a route to this network, which can be done using the following command:
      * =route ADD 130.83.0.0 MASK 255.255.0.0 $gateway METRIC 3 IF $adapter= (you have to be administrator to do that)
      * where $gateway is the standard gateway of the VPN connection and $adapter is the ID of the VPN adapter.
   * You can find the correct settings for $adapter and $gateway by typing =route print=
   * Unfortunately, you have to add the route each time you connect to the VPN. To keep things easy and fast, you might want to use this [[%ATTACHURL%/add_ukp_route.pl.txt][simple perl script]], which you can call shortly after connecting to the VPN.
      * Simply adjust =$ADAPTER_NAME= to match the name of your VPN adapter (if not =UKP=)
