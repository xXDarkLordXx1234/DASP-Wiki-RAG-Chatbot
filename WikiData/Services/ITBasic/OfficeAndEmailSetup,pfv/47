 %ENDTAB%
 %TAB{"Unfold old information about the migration"}%

*<u>What about my old mails in UKP mailbox after the migration?</u>*

All mails, contacts, and data have been transferred to your groupware mailbox, nothing should be missing.

*<u>Something is missing!</u>*

Please let system-admin know via ticket.

*<u>What is my mail address now?</u>*

Your primary mailaddress has changed, this is usually =firstname.lastname@tu-darmstadt.de=. you'll be sending mails from this address, so you should use this mail in your signatre and on any official stuff. your previous mailaddress like =lastname@ukp.tu-darmstadt.de= can still receive mails. New hires only have the =firstname.lastname@tu-darmstadt.de= address! If you want a shorter =@ukp.tu-darmstadt= address, then please open a ticket, specify your desired adress and TU ID.

*<u>Have central mails changed?</u>*

The central mails have not changed and any known mailaddress can still be used. in future, central addresses will only have the @ukp.tu-darmstadt.de ending, we'll stop using the "informatik" part.  Central mails should be listed in the central TU Darmstadt address book as well.

*<u>What are the login credentials for my mailbox?</u>*

You have to use your TU-ID to access mails, not UKP account.

*<u>Are there any restrictions for my mailbox size?</u>*

You have 2.5GB of mail space if not communicated otherwise.

*<u>Something that I want to know is not explained here.</u>*

There are also guides for other configurations if you search on the TU Darmstadt Groupware page. If you cant find it, let system-admin by opening a ticket.
