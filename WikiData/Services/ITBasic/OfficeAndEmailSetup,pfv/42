---++ FAQ
*<u>What about my old mails in UKP mailbox after the migration?</u>*

All mails, contacts, and data have been transferred to your groupware mailbox, nothing should be missing.

*<u>Something is missing!</u>*

Please let system-admin know via ticket.

*<u>What is my mail address now?</u>*

Your primary mailaddress has changed, this is usually vorname.nachname@tu-darmstadt.de. you'll be sending mails from this address, so you should use this mail in your signatre and on any official stuff. your previous mailaddress like nachname@ukp.tu-darmstadt.de can still receive mails. 

*<u>Have central mails changed?</u>*

The central mails have not changed and any known mailaddress can still be used. in future, central addresses will only have the @ukp.tu-darmstadt.de ending, we'll stop using the "informatik" part.  Central mails should be listed in the central TU Darmstadt address book as well.

*<u>What are the login credentials for my mailbox?</u>*

You have to use your TU-ID to access mails, not UKP account.

*<u>Are there any restrictions for my mailbox size?</u>*

You have 2.5GB of mail space if not communicated otherwise.

*<u>Something that I want to know is not explained here.</u>*

There are also guides for other configurations if you search on the TU Darmstadt Groupware page. If you cant find it, let system-admin by opening a ticket.
