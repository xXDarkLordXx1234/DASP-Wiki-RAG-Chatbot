---++ How to use Office 365 and access mail
   * *PLEASE NOTE*
      * Two different formats of your TU-ID are needed to activate office and setup your mail account in outlook!
      * You can get more instructions on how to install and activate office from [[https://www.hrz.tu-darmstadt.de/services/it_services/campus_software/microsoft/microsoft_ees/informationen_beschaeftigte_ohne_gemanagten_pc/index.en.jsp][the hrz webpage]]
      * Office 365 is licensed for employees and students of TU Darmstadt
      * The setup instructions for outlook mailaccounts don't apply to students and SHKs; they do not have a regular mailbox at TU Darmstadt like employees have. 

---+++ Cloud ID vs TU ID
   * *%RED%Cloud ID%ENDCOLOR%*
      * *Short: use Cloud-ID in the form "sa12egal@tu-darmstadt.de" where =sa12egal= is your TU-ID to activate office*
      * A window in e.g. outlook that needs this form looks like this:
      * %IMAGE{"cloud_id_login.png" size="200"}% 
   * *%RED%TU ID%ENDCOLOR%*
      * *Short: use TU-ID in the form "ads\sa12egal" to login to your mailbox in outlook where =sa12egal= is your TU-ID*
      * A window in e.g. outlook that needs this form looks like this:
