|seq2seq model + evaluation metrics |in progress |04.03 | |run my code on a GPU server + get evaluation metrics mentioned in the paper |  |
|add Profile information to encoder and decoder |New |10.03 | |an encoder function that maps a profile to a vector | CNN, CNN-based encoder-decoder |
|create a list of profiles and utterances said by each profile |New |10.03 | |training set for finding how much utterances are related to profiles | p0,u0,u1,u2,... \n p1,u0,u1,u2,... |
|create a list of profiles and utterances heard by each profile |New |10.03 | |training set for finding how much utterances are related to profiles | p0,u0,u1,u2,... \n p1,u0,u1,u2,... |
|create training/valid/test sets for experimenting how utterances are related to profiles of speaker and addresses |New |10.03 | |utterances are related to profiles of speakers or address? | create positive and negative labels |
|check the accuracy of the system on profile identification on utterances |New |10.03 | |train/test a neural model which takes a vector representation of an utterance and a vector representation of a profile and returns the probability of their association. | use CNN or transformer, we need to know why the system says that two inputs are not related! |
