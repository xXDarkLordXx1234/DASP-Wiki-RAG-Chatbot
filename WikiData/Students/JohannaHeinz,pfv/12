   * Problems with tagging -> indices don't match aspects
   * Differntiate between "model selection" and "model assessment" to prevent overfitted results.
      * model selection: Tuning parameters / features / etc on the dev set
      * model assessment: test generalizability of best model on the test set
   * TODO / next steps
      * Prepare structure for "approach/method" and "evaluation" section of thesis

   * Simple implementation of crf without cross topic setup -> pretty bad results (F1 score 0,207, recall 0,137)
