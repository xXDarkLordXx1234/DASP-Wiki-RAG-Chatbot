   * prepared data
   * Simple implementation of crf without cross topic setup -> pretty bad results (F1 score 0,207, recall 0,137)
   * template for thesis
   
---++ 2018-10-25
   * Structure for related work section
      * Argument Mining / Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
      * Sequence Tagging/Labeling
         * CRF?
         * LSTM?
         * ...
      * Ranking Methods 
         * Regression?
         * Learning to Rank?
         * Levy?
      * Chapter Summary
   * *Evaluation Setup*: Cross-topic -> train in n-1 and test on n (n = topic)
   * Keyword: Active Learning
   * TODO / next steps
      * Review papers and continue writing related work section. 
      * Start implementing 
         * Implement a crf (or other sequence taggers) example 
         * Preapre data and data splitting 
         * Implement evaltuation measures

   * paperwork
   * discuss task description 
   * discussed ranking approaches for aspect extraction 
   * evaluation metrics (How can e compare ranking and sequence modeling approaches?)
      * Solution 1: consider only best ranked candidate as actual "hit" and evaluate using token-level IOB/BIO tagging scheme
      * Solution 2: use approach described in http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S14-2004
   * *TODOS / next steps*
      * (DONE) *Formulate a good argument why we use ranking methods instead of common sequence labeling methods.* in the current version of the task description 
      * (DONE) Get familiar with keras / tensorflow -> LSTM-CRF
      * (DONE) Evaluation Setup: How to split the data? Cross-topic vs. In-topic vs. "we don't care about the topic"
      * Review papers and start writing related work section.

   * Forms for account, IP, etc. 
   * Discuss data to use for this project
   * Task description
   * Evaluation setup
   * @discussed: (1) selquence labeling vs. (2) ranking approaches
   * *Participate in the advanced seminar*: Dienstag 11:30 Raum B002+
   * *Todos / next steps*
      * Prepare forms and contract / etc.
      * Get familiar with the following methods CRF, LSTM-CRF and sequence-tagging (these models are for instance used for named-entity recognition,)
      * Get familiar with keras / tensorflow -> LSTM-CRF
      * Think about evaluation strategies w.r.t. to compare tagging and ranking approaches
      * Evaluation Setup: How to split the data? Cross-topic vs. In-topic vs. "we don't care about the topic"
