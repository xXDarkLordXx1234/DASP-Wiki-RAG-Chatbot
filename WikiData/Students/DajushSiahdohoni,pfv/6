---+!! Bachelor Thesis: A User Interface for Semantic Search on Translations of Cuneiform Documents
%TOC%
---++ Intro
I'm doing my bachelor thesis under the supervision of Dr. Des. Johannes Daxenberger and Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych.
In the scope of this thesis, I will prepare a set of given datas (more specifically: translated Hittite cuneiform documents) and apply linguistic processes to make them available for semantic search in a web-based user interface.

---++ Meeting 15.01.2016, 16:00
   * Topics
      * Parser
         * Finished Transliteration Parser
         * Setting of Meta-Data's: e.g. Document-Title, Language
         * Matching Translations with corresponding Transliteration
         * Setting CTH#, Paragraph# and Column# to each Colon.
      * Footnotes
         * Footnotes should not appear in the document-text, instead add them as annotations
         * Need to Update the structure of self-definded Field-Annotation.
      * Mid-term Talk will be held soon (26.01.2016) 
         * Think of a database model to show in the talk.
      * TODOs
         * Update Field-Annotation Structure, add Footnotes as annotations
         * Prepare Slides for the Talk

---++ Meeting 08.01.2016, 11:00
   * Topics
      * Discussed some problems regarding the transliteration parser.
         * Structure of documents is not alike.
         * There may be a different amount of tables/rows.
         * Sometimes there are several transliterations.
         * Need to define some rules to get the corresponding one
      * Skype Conference with our Partner in Mainz
         * Discussed some important questions regarding the datas
         * There is a protocol with further information.
      * TODOs
         * Finish the parser for the transliteration

---++ Meeting 28.12.2015, 17:00
   * Topics
      * Talked about my results until so far. e.g.:
         * How am I building a Cas?
         * How do I set the language?
         * How do I set annotations?
         * Whats the current output?
      * The annotations seem to be inserted correctly, but there is empty annotation at the end with leads to a exception.
      * A 2nd view is needed in order to set a correlation between translation and transliteration file.
      * A Skype conference with out partner in Mainz will be held in the next Meeting to clarify some important questions.
      * TODOs
         * Set a 2nd view for the cas with the corresponding transliteration file.
         * Write a simplified back-end (writer) for the pipeline, to get familiar with it.

---++ Meeting 17.12.2015, 16:30
   * Topics
      * Discussed my suggestion for the database structure.
         * Solution is improvable.
         * Perhaps RDF [51] or ODF [54] suits well to our problem.
      * Demonstration of the developed document parser.
         * Text is currently written into a '.txt' files, but should directly be put into a CAS and proceed with further linguistic processes.
      * Talked about some variations of the backend-writer component of the UIMA-Pipeline.
         * Own writer-component creation is preferred: Instant Insert-Statements or creation of a importable database-file.
      * Some questions considering the provided transcription and translation documents were left unanswered, meeting with our partner in Mainz should clear it up.
         * The meeting with out partner will take place in February 12th.
         * An second and earlier meeting is also under consideration.
      * TODOs
         * Proceed with the parser, create a CAS from the text input.
         * Go over the database model again and try to find a better solution.

---++ Meeting 08.12.2015, 16:30
   * Topics
      * what kind of dictionaries exist for Hittitie, incl. examples
      * What are some related works? Need to put them into the thesis.
      * Evaluation: Gather some students after programming has been done to evaluate the functionalities.
      * Cooperation with other ininstitutions who work on these datas is highly recommended. There will possibly be a meeting.
      * Talked about problems that ococcurredn the meantime. How can we solve these problems?
      * The .odt parser should harmonize with following programs like e.g. DKPro and Uby.
      * For a susubmittingn good time, work has to be speeded up.
      * TODOs
         * Deliver a suitable database model which allows semantic search which can be discussed about its goods and bads next time.
         * This model has to be kept in mind while developing e.g. the parser and further methods.

---+++ Meeting 23.10.2015, 16:30
   * Topics
      * Introduction to the topic
         * What is the Hittite language?
         * What are the datas which have to be made accessible for semantic search?
         * Who needs/works with these datas?
      * Scope of this thesis
      * There are two options for the focus of this thesis:
         * Focus more on the semantic search aspect. The database generated should be amamongther values as efficient, extendable and reusable as possible.
         * Focus on the User-Interface. Make the datas acaccessibleor semantic search but keep it rather simple.
      * TODOs
         * Decide whether I do or do not my thesis at the UKP Lab and inform as soon as possible.
