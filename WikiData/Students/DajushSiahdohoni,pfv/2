---+!! Bachelor Thesis: A User Interface for Semantic Search on Translations of Cuneiform Documents
%TOC%
---++ Intro
I'm doing my bachelor thesis under the supervision of Mr. Johannes Daxenberger and Prof. Dr. Iryna Gurevych.
In the scope of this thesis, I will prepare a set of given datas (more specifically: translated Hittite cuneiform documents) and apply linguistic processes to make them available for semantic search in a web-based user interface.
---++ Schedule
%EDITTABLE{format="| text,20| text,20| text,20|"}%
| *Week* | *Task* | *Comment* |
| 0-2 | Familiarization with the datasets, literature review, setup of the environment | Start writing the thesis as early as possible! |
| 3-5 | Development of an appropriate type system to pass the original data in a structured way into a UIMA pipeline | Use DKPro Core |
| 6-7 | Linguistic preprocessing of the data in various languages | Use DKPro Core |
| 8-10 | Enrich preprocessed data with semantic information | Use DKPro Core, Uby, and DKPro WSD |
| 11-13 | Draft design and develop database to store the semantically enriched documents | |
| 13 | Mid-term presentation | |
| 14-17 | Develop query and ranking interface | |
| 18-20 | Small user study to evaluate UI, in particular with respect to the relevancy of result of search queries | In collaboration with the owners of the data |
| 21-24 | Final thesis redaction | |
| 24 | Submit the thesis | |
| 24 | Final presentation | |
---++ Meetings
---++ Meetings 08.12.2015, 16:30
   * Topics
      * what kind of dictionaries exist for Hittitie, incl. examples
      * What are some related works? Need to put them into the thesis.
      * Evaluation: Gather some students after programming has been done to evaluate the functionalities.
      * Cooperation with other ininstitutionsho work on these datas is highly recommended. There will possibly be a meeting.
      * Talked about problems that ococcurredn the meantime. How can we solve these problems?
      * The .odt parser should harmonize with following programs like e.g. DKPro and Uby.
      * For a susubmittingn good time, work has to be speeded up.
      * TODOs
         * Deliver a suitable database model which allows semantic search which can be discussed about its goods and bads next time.
         * This model has to be kept in mind while developing e.g. the parser and further methods.
---+++ Meeting 24.11.2015, 16:30
   * Topics
      * Signed the final DeDescriptionf the bachelor thesis.
      * Decided the date of the mid-term talk(26.01.2016) and the final talk(26.4.2016).
      * Document for thesis registration.
      * Talked about the example programs.
      * TODOs
         * Try getting more familiar with the programs needed.
---+++ Meeting 19.11.2015, 16:00
   * Topics
      * Handed out: Draft version of the dedescriptionf the bachelor thesis, some Hittite documents (translations and transcription of original)
      * UKP Account Creation and Cloud Access for datas.
      * TODOs
         * Read into NLP, try some examples of DKPro Core and Uby.      
---+++ Meeting 12.11.2015, 16:00
   * Topics
      * Handed out: some 3-paged topic introduction
      * Talked in details about the individual parts of this thesis.
      * Talked about the ways of the functionality of NLP.
      * Talked about programs needed
         * DKPro Core
         * DKPro Uby
      * TODOs
         * Read into NLP, try some examples of DKPro Core and Uby.
---+++ Meeting 23.10.2015, 16:30
   * Topics
      * Introduction to the topic
         * What is the Hittite language?
         * What are the datas which have to be made accessible for semantic search?
         * Who needs/works with these datas?
      * Scope of this thesis
      * There are two options for the focus of this thesis:
         * Focus more on the semantic search aspect. The database generated should be amamongther values as efficient, extendable and reusable as possible.
         * Focus on the User-Interface. Make the datas acaccessibleor semantic search but keep it rather simple.
      * TODOs
         * Decide whether I do or do not my thesis at the UKP Lab and inform as soon as possible.
