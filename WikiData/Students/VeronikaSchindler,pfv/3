---+!! Master's Thesis: Combining Crowdsourced Annotations Using HeatmapBCC For NLP Tasks

---++ Meetings

---+++ 28.11.17

   * Weather dataset obtained
   * Word embeddings:
      * Skipthoughts -- not found, check out on Barney, there is a version under /data/skipthoughts
      * Gensim word2vec -- available but trained on Google news data rather than Wikipedia
      * Infersent -- available following the instructions on readme at top level in Infersent Github
      * Siamese CBOW trained on Wikipedia 2015
      * Glove trained on Wikipedia 2014
   * PyIBCC error -- needs ES to fix
   * TODO: 
      * Completing the end-to-end experiment set up with baselines
      * Run the algorithm with the Weather and Compatibility datasets with varying number of labels
      * Run evaluation metrics accuracy, f1score and logloss from scikit learn
      * Plot results using matplotlib or a nice wrapper library  

---+++ 14.11.17

   * Sentence embeddings: download the models and Python interfaces to a home directory, e.g. on Barney or other server
      * Skipthoughts
      * Siamese-CBOW 
      * Infersent
      * Glove (word embeddings, need to take mean vectors for sentences)
      * Gensim (word embeddings, need to take mean vectors for sentences)
   * Now have access to the repo for Paul Felt's work
      * Need to try running the script including the experiment with the weather dataset
      * Weather dataset appears to be missing -- see whether running the script produces an error
      * If there is missing data, notify Paul and ask if he is able to upload it elsewhere 
   * Continue asking Crowdflower for weather data -- can ask Christopher for contact if no luck
   * Paralllel for loops in Python: https://pythonhosted.org/joblib/parallel.html
   * Dask: Pandas in parallel
   * Bug in IBCC code -- send link to code to ES so he can reproduce the error
   * MACE: convert the data from 3 column format to a table format
   * discussion of the impact of different word embeddings is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06799

---+++ 07.11.17

   * Progress on implementing MACE, IBCC, and majority vote baselines
   * Data imported for weather dataset into local format
   * Emails sent to author of comparison paper asking for access to data/code
   * Todos: 
      * set IBCC parameters in constructor according to example sent by email
      * set MACE to provide probabilities using --distribution
      * Produce plots using the baselines with increasing numbers of annotations per document
      * Contact Paul Felt if no luck from Kevin Seppi; if this is unsuccessful look at how code from ES can be adapted to implement their baseline
