---++ Meetings

---+++ 14.11.17

---+++ 07.11.17

   * Progress on implementing MACE, IBCC, and majority vote baselines
   * Data imported for weather dataset into local format
   * Emails sent to author of comparison paper asking for access to data/code
   * Todos: 
      * set IBCC parameters in constructor according to example sent by email
      * set MACE to provide probabilities using --distribution
      * Produce plots using the baselines with increasing numbers of annotations per document
      * Contact Paul Felt if no luck from Kevin Seppi; if this is unsuccessful look at how code from ES can be adapted to implement their baseline
