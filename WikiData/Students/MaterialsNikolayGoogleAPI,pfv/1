Access Google Translate API

 

AJAX Language API - using Javascript the usual way:
http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/
 

the Language API now supports strings up to 5,000 characters
in length if you use the POST method.  Using GET (e.g., through the AJAX API), you
will still run into trouble depending on your individual browser's limitations on the
amount of data you can pass through the url
http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-apis/issues/detail?id=18

Apparently, servers have recently been limited GET request lengths
to under 2,000 characters.  So, to do a 5,000 character request, you must use POST
which is not supported in the Javascript implementation of the API

For Flash developers, and those developers that have a need to access the AJAX Language API from other Non-Javascript environments, the API exposes a simple RESTful interface. In all cases, the method supported is GET and the response format is a JSON encoded result with embedded status codes. Applications that use this interface must abide by all existing terms of use. An area to pay special attention to relates to correctly identifying yourself in your requests. Applications MUST always include a valid and accurate http referer header in their requests. In addition, we ask, but do not require, that each request contains a valid API Key. By providing a key, your application provides us with a secondary identification mechanism that is useful should we need to contact you in order to correct any problems.

http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/documentation/reference.html

Key - If specified, it must be a valid key associated with your site which is validated against the passed referer header.

The batch interface, which is only available with the RESTful framework, allows for multiple translations to occur in a single call through the use of multiple q and/or langpair arguments

. Translate several strings, all from the same source language to the same target language

. Translate one string into several languages

. Translate several strings, each into a different language

http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/language/

translate?v=1.0&q=hello%20world&langpair=en%7Cit&q=goodbye&langpair=en%7Cfr
