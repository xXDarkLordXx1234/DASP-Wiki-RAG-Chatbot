---++ Meeting: 26.04.2018:

   * Evaluation: [[http://fever.ai/task.html][FEVER webpage]]

   * TODOs: 
      * Clarify if we can use documents for classification or only the selected evidence
      * Information retrieval: talk to Andreas, Richard, Chris, ... how this can be done?
      * Hao: 
         * Prepare dataset for sentence selection (a set of documents with annotated evidence and without)
         * Apply the implemented classifiers for stance detection for the task and compare to baseline performance
      * Zile: 
         * Prepare dataset for claim validation (a set evidence for each claim containing )
         * Implement the pipeline the baseline pipeline and reproduce the results (once access to the server granted)
         * Apply the implemented classifiers for stance detection for the task and compare to baseline performance
   * Modules:
      * Information retrieval: We need to create an index for search using [[https://lucene.apache.org/][Lucene]]; [[https://github.com/lemire/IndexWikipedia][Creating Lucene index for Wikipedia dump]]
      * Evidence aggregation (consider as classification problem on sentence level): universal encoders (Facebook, Google), try to train our own sentence encoder, claim validation models, conditional encoders, SNLI multiNLI models ....
         * Can be later considered as content extraction or contextual ranking problem in order to facilitate the collection of linked evidence
      * Claim validation (classification problem): basically the same classifier as for the evidence aggregation


   








---++ Important information about the task

   * Documents: The document collection is whole Wikipedia (5.4M pages)
   * Evidence: "in 31.75% of the claims more than one sentence was considered appropriate evidence. Claims require composition of evidence from multiple sentences in 16.82% of cases. Furthermore, in 12.15% of the claims, this evidence was taken from multiple pages."
