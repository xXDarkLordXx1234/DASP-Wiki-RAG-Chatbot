         * We need to find out how many documents we should retrieve in order to extract the correct set of sentences 
         * Error analysis to be perform: what kind of errors are made, how can we improve
         * Other approaches: 
            * Train our own sentence encoder on the data and use ranking loss, use Google sentence encoder with trained units
            * Use average word embeddings
            * LSTM with attention from Andreas Rückle

            * Gold and randomly sampled
            * Only gold documents
            * Run the baseline document retrieval in order to extract the documents    

   * Evaluation:
      * Each claim has several evidence sets for support and we have to identify one of them 

   * Textual entailment: 
      * Google universal encoder (53%) does not outperform baseline (63% DecAttention)
      * TODO:

      * SOA SNLI models: u-v||u*v||u||v 
      * Sentence encoder from Andreas Rückle
 ))

---++ Meeting: 02.05.2018:
   * Evaluation: 5 sentences the rest will not be considered

   * Aisha will apply contextual ranking methods in order to evidence extraction (Hao needs to provide the data)

   * Joint model: use an attention model for claim validaion
  
   * Evidence extraction
      * Extend the dataset with more irrelevant documents since in the real setting we will have documents with no evidence
      * Evidence extraction first results: We beat the baseline but recall is quite low since the dataset only contains a small number of evidence (biased distribution)
      * TODO Hao: 
         * Implement Deep rank model: scoring with negative examples be pushed away: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.4661.pdf

   * Claim validation
      * Prepared the dataset from training set with 5 sentences for each claim with random examples from additional unrelated sentences 
      * TODO Zile:
         * Slack ask question regarding number of sentences, are we just allowed to use the 5 sentences which are selected as evidence or more information for claim validation
         * Implement the FEVER baseline and reproduce the results
         * Implement classifiers for claim validation:
            * Google universal encoder (Facebook InferSent)
            * Separate encoder for the sentence and the claim
            * Conditional encoding
         * Find out state of the art models for SNLI and multiNLI (we could also use them)
   
   * TODOs: 
      * Evaluation metric for the task to be clarified: formal definition
      * Information retrieval: talk to Andreas, Richard, Chris, ... how this can be done?

   * Links:
      * [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05355.pdf][paper]] 
      * [[http://fever.ai/task.html][shared task]]
   * Modules:
      * Information retrieval: We need to create an index for search using [[https://lucene.apache.org/][Lucene]]; [[https://github.com/lemire/IndexWikipedia][Creating Lucene index for Wikipedia dump]]
         * Elastic search, BM 24, faiss Facebook semantic search 
      * Evidence aggregation (consider as classification problem on sentence level): universal encoders (Facebook, Google), try to train our own sentence encoder, claim validation models, conditional encoders, SNLI multiNLI models ....
         * Considering as ranking problem Can be later considered as content extraction or contextual ranking problem in order to facilitate the collection of linked evidence
         * Considering as content selection: Simply generate conditional sequences, Beam search, Monte Carlo Tree search, ILP, Decoder LSTM condition on claim select the most likely sentence, ... 
         * Considering as ranking problem: ...
      * Claim validation (classification problem): basically the same classifier as for the evidence aggregation
         * SOA NLI models: u-v||u*v||u||v 
      * Joint learning of sentence aggregation and claim validation: Memory networks, ILP, reinforcement learning

   * Models to be tried out:
      * Google universal encoder
      * Facebook InferSent
      * Separate encoder for the sentence and the claim
      * Conditional encoding
      * Attention based models
      * ...
      
   * Joint model:
      * One hop reasoning: Sentence encoder, conditional decoding LSTM (generates a sequence of evidence), inference module (predicts a label for the claim on the basis of the evidence sequence),  joint loss function for evidence selection and label prediction, (attention for selection, keys values to be considered)
      * Three hop reasoning: Same as above but we have additionally three options to choose from, additional selection module? 


   * Miscellaneous:
      * Documents: The document collection is whole Wikipedia (5.4M pages)
      * Evidence: "in 31.75% of the claims more than one sentence was considered appropriate evidence. Claims require composition of evidence from multiple sentences in 16.82% of cases. Furthermore, in 12.15% of the claims, this evidence was taken from multiple pages."
