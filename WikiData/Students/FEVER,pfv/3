---++ Meeting: 26.04.2018:
   * Agenda: 
      * Introduction
      * Presentation of the task, dataset and baseline
      * Discussion: Evidence selection: Ranking VS sequence labeling VS sentence classification  

   * TODOs: 
      * Formula for evaluation metric (link to the example, link to the challenge)
      * Clarify Baseline Evaluation document selection 
      * Clarify if we can use documents of classification

   * Modules:
      * Information retrieval: Andreas, Richard, Chris, ...
      * Classifiction Classification Problem on sentence level, universal encoders, try our own sentence encoder, ....
      * Claim validation: 

   Zile start with claim validation
   








---++ Important information about the task

   * Documents: The document collection is whole Wikipedia (5.4M pages)
   * Evidence: "in 31.75% of the claims more than one sentence was considered appropriate evidence. Claims require composition of evidence from multiple sentences in 16.82% of cases. Furthermore, in 12.15% of the claims, this evidence was taken from multiple pages."
