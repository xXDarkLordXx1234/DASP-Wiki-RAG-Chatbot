---+++ Master Thesis: Nutzen eines Klassifizierers um Multi-Satz-Sequenz-Labeler mithilfe von Reinforcement Learining zu trainieren
*TODO:* Inserts description here.
---+++ Meeting 18.07.2019
   * *Status:* 
   Three different datasets were in consideration, but only one was processable for usage. The dataset to use is the EMNLP-2015 from IBM. The data has been preprocessed and word embeddings should be trained, but self trained word embeddings seen to be not as good as pretrained ones. 
   * *Next Steps:* 
      * Use pretrained word embeddings (glove). 
      * Start experiments with MLP and CNN.
      * Develope state space and reward function for reinforcement learning
      * What is evidence? Especially in comparison to an argument. See stanford enzyclopedia and ACL-15/18.
