---+++ Evaluation of a basic implementation of a HPSSC without UIMA

   * Aim is to get a quick overview of the performance of the HPSSC
   * Three relevant values are measured 
      * Precision: Correct found sentences divided by all found sentences
      * Recall:Correct found sentences divided by all correct sentences
      * F-Measure: 2*Precision*Recall / (Precision + Recall)
   * A sentence is classified as subjective depending on the amount of subjective clues in this sentence
   * Subjective clues are word that appear in a lexicon (list of words)
   * Two lexica are use; One with positive subjective clues (~1000) and one with negative subjective clues (~1000)
   * Depending on the threshold (necessary amount of subjective clues) there are different results
   * It compares only sentences marked as certain as well as all sentences (certain and not_sure)
      * one subjective clues
         * Precision: 0.71 (certain), 0.70 (all)
         * Recall: 0.18 (certain), 0.17 (all)
         * F-Measure 0.29 (certain), 0.28 (all)
      * two subjective clues
         * Precision: 0.78 (certain), 0.79 (all)
         * Recall: 0.04 (certain), 0.04 (all)
         * F-Measure 0.08 (certain), 0.07 (all)
      * three subjective clues
         * Precision: 1.0 (certain), 1.0 (all)
         * Recall: 0.004 (certain), 0.004 (all)
         * F-Measure 0.09 (certain), 0.008 (all)
       * four subjective clues
         * Precision: 1.0 (certain), 1.0 (all)
         * Recall: 0.004 (certain), 0.004(all)
         * F-Measure 0.09 (certain), 0.008 (all)
   * Results:
      * For none of the thresholds the combination of precision and recall is sufficient for a HPSSC
      * The difference between sentences marked as certain and marked as not_sure is not significant
      * See additional page for examples of wrong classified sentences
   * Improvements:
      * The lexica should be exchanged by lexica with more words
      * Lemmatisation should be used to cover derivated forms of words
      * UIMA should be applied to simplify the
