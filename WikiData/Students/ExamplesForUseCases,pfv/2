---++++ User Scenarios / Research Questions
Given the nascent state of research on historical collections of web sites, the facilitation of
searching collections of web sites will undoubtedly present user scenarios and research questions
that could not have been predicted. Below are several sets of user scenarios and research
questions that are indicative of where research such as this can lead.

---+++++ The internet scholar
Consider a masters student in a social science program with a background in the humanities.
She is studying the coverage of the two world wars on the web. She is computer&#8208;literate, but
does not have any programming or highly&#8208;technical skills. She is good with word&#8208;processing
programs and spreadsheets, but not much beyond that. She gathers lists of all the web sites
she finds by doing topic&#8208;related subject searches in Google. In order to get lists of links, she
clicks on each link and then copies and pastes it into the spreadsheet.
Questions might be:
   * How many of the sites are about WWI vs. WWII?
   * What has been the annual count of sites for the last 7 years?
   * What is the creation date of the pages? [She would like to identify trends in when the pages were created? Does it cluster? Or has it been a steady building process?
   * What languages are the pages in?
   * How many of the sites are from educational domains (.ac or .edu) vs. commercial domains?
 
---+++++ The social network analyst
This example is a doctoral student who is interested in social network analysis. He is interested
in whether there are visible networks of web sites that have grown up around WWI and WWII
sites and whether there are any noticeable hubs. To identify the seed sites, he starts with
subject searches, but has written a program that scrapes the URLs from the first 10 pages of
search results. He would like a snapshot of the relationships between (inlinks, outlinks, coinlinks
and co&#8208;outlinks) between all of the sites he can find on WWI and WWII every 3 years.
A web archive might contain important information about where amateur or professional
historians/genealogists/veterans gather, providing historians with ways of contacting groups
or individuals who may be able to help them with their work. Pages/Sites which had provided
a popular meeting place, for instance, but which may no longer exist, might help the historian
to develop similar resources.
Questions might be:
   * Where on the web do historians/genealogists/veterans gather to talk about their
research/experiences?
   * What kinds of web pages/sites attract contributions from those who experienced the war?
   * What (online) methods can be developed to attract such contributions?
   * Researchers might also use the web pages to gather information about other researchers experiences of known archives, revealing strengths and weaknesses, problems or advantages.
   * Which are the key archives in this area? How easy is it to extract relevant information from them?
   * Have these archives been used for my purposes before?
   * Has the release of certain documents/data made specific events/sources/historical interpretations more popular among these groups?

---+++++The linguist
For this example, consider a linguist who is studying the historical use and understanding of
the word dictator from the beginning of world war one to the end of world war two. She
would also like to analyze contemporary use of the word in relationship in regard to accounts
of both wars. She has used Zotero to take snapshots of a sample of web pages. She has
separated the sites (by hand) into two categories  those containing historical documents and
those containing contemporary accounts. Within each group of sites, Suzanne would like to
identify the pages that contain the word and those that dont. Within the pages that contain
the word, she would like them ranked by word frequency. She is interested in the overall
findings and whether the data is from a page that is current or no longer exists is of only
anecdotal importance to her research.
Questions might be:
   * How are meaningful words clustered by geography? Is the word dictator more likely to occur in pages from certain countries?
   * How frequently are politically charged words used in materials in official collections (such as libraries and museums) versus on the open web?
   * Are pages that contain certain highly charged words also more likely to link to each other?
   
---+++++ The personal history scholar
A great many sites covering the two World Wars contain personal testimony and copies of
original sources such as photographs, letters and official documentation. It may be that
members of the public who might not think to approach an archive or library with their own
story or personal mementos would be more likely to mount details or copies of their
mementos online. Often people have responded to sites which invite those who lived through
these events to contribute their memories, and people may be more willing to do so in the
privacy of their homes via the internet, than (for instance) to take the trouble to attend a more
formal local history event. One of the attractions of these sites to historians, therefore, might
be that they offer previously unavailable or untapped primary sources.
Questions might be:
   * How many photographic sources are available on the web for WW1 /2?
   * How many personal reminiscences are available?
   * When were the reminiscences written?
   * When were these sources collected?
   * How reliable are these sources?
   * Which are the most popular sources to present on internet sites?
   * Why might these sources be more prevalent  does this tell us more about society now or society then?
   * Do these sources/accounts challenge the current historiography?
   * To what extent have these sources been overlooked by historians? Why?

---+++++ Scholar interested in historiography
An archive of websites such as this might give historians the opportunity to survey a different
kind of historiography, which might exist largely outside the academy. The two World Wars
attract a great deal of interest from amateur historians, and this may be of use to professional
historians, documenting areas of interest, and the way that they are presented. You could
trace popular events, sources, discussions etc, and map different historical and
historiographical trends. You could also trace the impact of the digitisation or release of
certain archives or repositories.
Questions might be:
   * How does the web historiography on the two World Wars compare to that present elsewhere?
   * How can such historiography add to our knowledge of these events?
   * Are these sources more or less subject to historical trends? Is this useful?
   * Which archives/sources have become popular with amateur historians?

A web archive might also allow historians to search through conference web pages for
references to people/subjects/papers. This would allow unpublished or ongoing work to be
traced, and would also allow historians to make informal approaches to colleagues who have
spoken on relevant subjects.
Questions might be:
   * How many conferences have been organised on a particular subject/set of resources?
   * Who has attended/presented work at these conferences?
   * Who is working on this area but not publishing their work?

---+++++ Scholar interested in national/international perspectives
An archive which contained web material from a variety of different countries would provide
useful information for researchers interested in exploring international perspectives on the
conflict. Viewing the development of particular pages or sites might allow the historian to
understand shifting perspectives or attitudes, and to understand the way in which particular
events are viewed by different groups. This would allow historians to approach these issues
with greater sensitivity and success (one would hope!).
Questions might be:
   * How are the World Wars viewed in contemporary (e.g. French/German/Polish/American)
society?
   * Have these perspectives shifted in recent years?
   * Do these perspectives differ across social groups?
   * Can we trace these perspectives to particular historical events/experiences?
These sample scenarios are just a few among many potential areas of research. As noted
elsewhere in this report, it is very important to recruit subject domain experts, not simply
discipline specific scholars, at the beginning of a project such as this one if the resulting collections
are going to have a greater chance of having a lasting impact. The assembly of collections such as
this remains a time&#8208;consuming and labour&#8208;intensive process that needs to be streamlined if
researchers are likely to engage in this sort of research. This is partly tied to the specificity of
much humanities and social science research: an individual scholar or small handful of scholars
often need to create and use very specialised collections, but do not currently have adequate tools
to enable that activity. Also, there needs to be considerable additional work to leverage and
simplify tools for analyzing both inbound and outbound links to web resources at a larger scale,
which in turn will inspire new research questions.
