   * [DB]: Interesting reference for passage retrieval: http://hamotzi.blogspot.com/2008/10/biased-lexrank-passage-retrieval-using.html 
      * [CM]: Looks promising for ranking and to improve the results of the similarity measures (works almost like <nop>PageRank, that I considered earlier for ranking, so it's actually a nice extension). I'm still annotating some answers to gain an evaluation base. After that I can try the algorithm and see if it works fine with our data. Thanks for the link.
