---+!! Notes

Scalable IMMC implementation
   * According to AVParallel of Williamson, I splitted the dataset according to a Dirichlet distribution. 
   * After each iteration, coordinator should propose a cluster to be moved. Williamson uses a proposal based on size of clusters. 
      * We can do better than this. For example, compute similarity of each clusters in different process and choose one according to a similarity metric.
      * Similarity Metric:
         * Internal structure of MC? (Graph similarity)
   * Then a metropolis hasting step decides whether or not it would be moved.
   * Move the cluster from a proc to another one
      * Data
      * Stats info
         * What variable should be moved?
         * IMMC uses L as approximate upper limit. What if there is no empty cluster in the destination proc?



Further works:
   * Visualization!
   * We need a metric to measure goodness of a model in regard to the dataset. So that we could compare different models. also to make sure that the scalable version keep the quality while brings speed up
   * Merge split step
   * At the end, I think we also should merge the similar clusters
   * How scalable can it get in regard to the number of processing resources?
   * What we can do to parallelize local computation?
   * Find a NLP application!
      * Word Sense Induction (WSI)
      * Event Sequence Description (ESD)
