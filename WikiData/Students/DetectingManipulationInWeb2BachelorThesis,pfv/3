-- Main.ArdalanNaseri - 01 Feb 2010

 I have crawled more than 3,500,000 reviews from Amazon, some Informations about products should be downloaded and I am downloading these infos.

 2 Feb 2010 : 
The number of reviews in the database is about 4 millions  now.
I am trying to use Hashfunctions in order to detect duplicate reviews, however access to this large amount of data is too slow, and if the body of reviews are not exactly the same, I will have different values as the result of hashing. I have run just for 2 products and tried to find duplicate reviews, but it took more than 2 minutes. Moreover, I think if I should give a number to duplicates in my database to find these duplicate easier or is there any better solution.

3 Feb 2010 :
report has been changed. the new version has been uploaded as pdf.
