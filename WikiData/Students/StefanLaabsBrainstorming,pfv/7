---++ First outlines:

%TOC%

---+++ 1. Introduction/Motivation
 
---+++ 2. State-of-the-art

*First part: (in research)* _(earlier?!?)_
   * State of the art in academic research (Papers on text similarity, summarization, information structuring, ... )
   * Usage of NLP techniques in other areas in practice and their usability factors (Books on search interface/ recommender systems)
_(-> What could be achieved?)_

_Basic ideas:_

_Show that the topic of NLP (in wikis) has a lot of research._

_Lots of groups work on NLP_

_Usable quality of results in different areas_

_example: document similarity_

---++++ 2.1 StandAlone Systems 

---++++ 2.2 Wiki PlugIns 
*Second part: (in practice)*
   * Other existing applications (which use these ideas) _( -> What exists in other areas?)_
   * Existing PlugIns _( -> What is missing?)_

    _here i would like to use some simple statistics of Wiki plug-Ins_
    _basic ideas: show the gap between NLP in research an in practice_
    _Number of PlugIns shows better the gap_
    
like: (Columns: Area of Usage - Rows: Area of Techniques/Advantages/Support )

%EDITTABLE{}%
|  *Wiki Plug-Ins*  |||||
| Area of underlying techiques | *Area of usage* |||
|^| *Find* | *Edit* | *Organize* |
| Usability | x1 | x2 | lots(z3) |
| Structuring | y1 | some(y2) | y3 |
| NLP | few(x1) | few(x2) | few(x3) |
| ... | | | |

... some PlugIns in Detail. (Good example, close to topic, ... )

* Conception of the Matrix
   * 3 Basic Columns, where the working area of the PlugIn is listed (see Paper: Find, Edit, Organize)
      * Dividing of the columns in how far they are aiming to the topic of this work
      * 0: Idea is already part of the wiki system 
      * A: Aims at an area where NLP could be applied (but not implemented)
      * B: Aims at an area where NLP could be applied, but another technique is implemented
      * C: Aims at an area where NLP could be applied and is somehow implemented
      * D: Feature is implemented and also has some improvements in the usability 
   * Rows: What is the plugin doing? Adding? ....

Example:
There are quite a lot of PlugIns that are aiming on an improved Suggestion for further readings and for adding Links.
The PlugIn MW:SeeAlso is just adding in internationalization to the adding of links for further readings, so it is settled in the area, but not using any NLP technique: A
The PlugIn MW:DidYouMean also adds some NLP features to find links with little differences in the spelling
The PlugIN MW:LinkSuggest is using similar techniques but is also already integrating the search in the editing process

_Basic ideas:_

_What do PlugIns offer? What exist? Why?_

_Introducing the GAP between scientific research and average PlugIn development._

_(*TODO*: search paper/statistics on PlugIn Development)_

-> _Reasons_???

_POV: general/researcher/developer/designer/user_

leads to: motivation to reduce the gap

---+++ 3. Strategy/Concept
 
---++++ 3.1. Theoretische Grundlagen

Something about the problem that led to the gap

* Main Question: (POV:general/researcher)*

   1. What additional informations can be achieved by using NLP? And how? (-> list)
      1. Similar texts
      2. extraction of keyphrases
      3. finding synonyms
      4. ....
   2. How can they help the users of a wiki? (->list)
       1. find duplicates, find related articles, ...
       2. find articles, summarization, ...
       3. ...

*Introduction to wikulu*

How it works. .... ... ....

*Defining and selecting some examples for implementation*

Selection of examples for implementation.

Reasons.

-> Basic tasks of thesis

---++++ 3.2. Use cases

*Defining user classes*
   1. New User/Explorer: Unexperienced in the usage of wikis and comparable systems
   2. Advanced User: Familiar with most of the features
   3. Top User: Administrates/Moderates the Wiki, Organization

*Defining use cases*
   1. Read something about ...
   2. Put in informations about ... 
   3. Structure existing information ...
_have to been broken down in quite small and basic tasks: analysis step-by-step_

---+++++ Starting Defining the Use Cases:

*Setting:*
Small company with a new wiki system, that already contains some articles.
Willing to put all relevant informations quickly to the wiki for further uses.

*First Level Use Cases:*

Level 1 User: Experienced employee know a lot about the company, but is new in the use of a wiki.
Is told to add some informations related to his work into the wiki.
So the first step is to find the relevant artice or be sure that there is none.

Finding the artice:
   * Getting a term in mind for the topic
   * Search the search interface ;-) (differnt in TWIKI and MediaWiki)
   * Phrasing a search query 
   * Checking the results
   * A: He things none fits his topic
   * B: He finds an article and wants to add/change some parts

Where can NLP help?

- Query, Search Interface, Results
  
A: Creating an artice:
   * He sets a topic/name for his artice
   * He starts writing (text, headlines, links)
   * _Works on layout (tables)_
   * _Structuring the content_

Further questions: How is the process in mind? What is the order of the steps? Fixed or individual?

Where can NLP help?

- Finding good Topic, Organization, Structuring, Linking

When can these techniques applied and when are they needed?

How should they be deigned?

B: Changing an existing article
   * _quite similar to A_

*Conception and development of new PlugIns*

Ideas from the use cases should now be a starting point for the development of the new PlugIns.

_( -> Which ideas are implementable? How much work? Existing structure)_

_Conception of Design/Design Principles_

---+++ 4. Design

Guidlines, Heuristics, Norms and Rules to use

Other Usability Techniques to apply (KSL Method, c. Walkthrough)

Results of first design analysis

---+++ 4. Implementation of Mock-Ups

Building the mock ups....

---+++ 5. First Evaluation
---+++ 6. Implementation
---+++ 7. Second Evaluation

---+++ 8. General Discussion

---+++ 9. Conclusions
---+++ 10. References
