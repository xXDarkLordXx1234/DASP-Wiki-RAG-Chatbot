   * [[%ATTACHURL%/StateOfTheArt05de.pdf][StateOfTheArt05de.pdf]]: Entwurf von Kapitel 2 - Version 0.5

---+++ 3. Strategy/Concept
 
---++++ 3.1. Theoretische Grundlagen

Something about the problem that led to the gap

* Main Question: (POV:general/researcher)*

   1. What additional informations can be achieved by using NLP? And how? (-> list)
      1. Similar texts
      2. extraction of keyphrases
      3. finding synonyms
      4. ....
   2. How can they help the users of a wiki? (->list)
       1. find duplicates, find related articles, ...
       2. find articles, summarization, ...
       3. ...

*Introduction to wikulu*

How it works. .... ... ....

*Defining and selecting some examples for implementation*

Selection of examples for implementation.

Reasons.

-> Basic tasks of thesis

---++++ 3.2. Use cases

*Defining user classes*
   1. New User/Explorer: Unexperienced in the usage of wikis and comparable systems
   2. Advanced User: Familiar with most of the features
   3. Top User: Administrates/Moderates the Wiki, Organization

*Defining use cases*
   1. Read something about ...
   2. Put in informations about ... 
   3. Structure existing information ...
_have to been broken down in quite small and basic tasks: analysis step-by-step_

---+++++ Starting Defining the Use Cases:

*Setting:*
Small company with a new wiki system, that already contains some articles.
Willing to put all relevant informations quickly to the wiki for further uses.

*First Level Use Cases:*

Level 1 User: Experienced employee know a lot about the company, but is new in the use of a wiki.
Is told to add some informations related to his work into the wiki.
So the first step is to find the relevant artice or be sure that there is none.

Finding the artice:
   * Getting a term in mind for the topic
   * Search the search interface ;-) (differnt in TWIKI and MediaWiki)
   * Phrasing a search query 
   * Checking the results
   * A: He things none fits his topic
   * B: He finds an article and wants to add/change some parts

Where can NLP help?

- Query, Search Interface, Results
  
A: Creating an artice:
   * He sets a topic/name for his artice
   * He starts writing (text, headlines, links)
   * _Works on layout (tables)_
   * _Structuring the content_

Further questions: How is the process in mind? What is the order of the steps? Fixed or individual?

Where can NLP help?

- Finding good Topic, Organization, Structuring, Linking

When can these techniques applied and when are they needed?

How should they be deigned?

B: Changing an existing article
   * _quite similar to A_

*Conception and development of new PlugIns*

Ideas from the use cases should now be a starting point for the development of the new PlugIns.

_( -> Which ideas are implementable? How much work? Existing structure)_

_Conception of Design/Design Principles_

---+++ 4. Design

Guidlines, Heuristics, Norms and Rules to use

Other Usability Techniques to apply (KSL Method, c. Walkthrough)

Results of first design analysis

---+++ 4. Implementation of Mock-Ups
---+++ 5. First Evaluation
---+++ 6. Implementation
---+++ 7. Second Evaluation

---+++ 8. General Discussion

---+++ 9. Conclusions
---+++ 10. References
