---++ First outlines:

---+++ 1. TOC

---+++ 2. Introduction

---++++ A. A first and short Definition of the task and overview

   * Main question
   * Situation at UKP
   * Goals


_Working-titles-of-ideas:_

How can the results of NLP research assist in a usage of wikis?

What algorithms and solutions exists already and where can they help?

At the end should be found some applications for theses algorithms and maybe some further ideas...

 
---++++ B. State-of-the-art

*First part: (in research)*
   * State of the art in academic research (Papers on text similarity, summarization, information structuring, ... )
   * Usage of NLP techniques in other areas in practice and their usability factors (Books on search interface/ recommender systems)
_(-> What could be achieved?)_

*Second part: (in practice)*
   * Other existing applications (which use these ideas) _( -> What exists in other areas?)_
   * Existing PlugIns _( -> What is missing?)_

    _here i would like to use some simple statistics of Wiki plug-Ins_
    _basic ideas: show the gap between NLP in research an in practice_
    _Number of PlugIns shows better the gap_
    
like: (Columns: Area of Usage - Rows: Area of Techniques/Advantages/Support )

|  *Wiki Plug-Ins*  ||||
|| *Find* | *Edit* | *Organize* |
| Usability | x1 | x2 | lots(z3) |
| Structuring | y1 | some(y2) | y3 |
| NLP | few(x1) | few(x2) | few(x3) |
| ... | | | |

... some PlugIns in Detail. (Good example, close to topic, ... )

---++++ C. Detailed definition of problem and task

Something about the problem that led to the gap
Defining some examples for implementation
Basic ideas of thesis

---+++ 3. Description

---++++ Conception of the first task analysis

*Defining user classes*
1. New User/Explorer: Unexperienced in the usage of wikis and comparable systems
2. Advanced User: Familiar with most of the features
3. Top User: Administrates/Moderates the Wiki, Organization

*Defining use cases*
1. Read something about ...
2. Put in informations about ... 
3. Structure existing information ...
_have to been broken down in quite small and basic tasks: analysis step-by-step_

*Conception and development of new PlugIns*

Ideas from the use cases should now be a starting point for the development of the new PlugIns.
_( -> Which ideas are implementable? How much work? Existing structure?)_
_Conception of Design/Design Principles_

---+++ 4. Implementation of Mock-Ups
---+++ 5. First Evaluation
---+++ 6. Implementation
---+++ 7. Second Evaluation

---+++ 5. Critics
Discussion of missing point, personal statements

---+++ 6. General Discussion

---+++ 7. Summary

---+++ 8. Literature
