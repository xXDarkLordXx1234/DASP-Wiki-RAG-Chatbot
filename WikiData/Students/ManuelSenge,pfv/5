---++++ *Bachelor Thesis* : A Survey on the Effectiveness of Differential Privacy in the NLP Domain  

*Supervisor*: Timour Igamberdiev


*Start Date* : 05.04.2021 

*Mid-Term Presentation Date* :  xx.xx.2021 

*Final Presentation Date* : xx.xx.2021  

*End Date*: 04.10.2021


---++++ *Weekly overview*
---+ *05.04.2021 - 09.04.2021*

*Status after the Last Week:*

   * LSTM and Bert models are both implemented
   * The ability to switch between DP and no DP was included
   * Fintuning (explicitly state which layer of the Bert model should be trained) was included


*To-Dos For Current Week:*

   * implement early stopping class for epochs
   * check accuracy for model improvements instead of loss
   * use 5 different seeds for training
   * run on the cluster and get accurate results for different model architectures 
  
---+ *12.04.2021 - 16.04.2021*

*Status after the Last Week:*

   * implemented early stopping with accuracy and 5 Seeds.
   * started to run the following models on the cluster:
      * LSTM with no differential privacy and small spacy English model
      * LSTM with no differential privacy and large spacy English model
      * Transformer with no differential privacy where all layers of the Bert model are frozen
      * Transformer with no differential privacy where all but the last two layers are frozen
      * Transformer with no differential privacy and no Bert layers frozen 



*To-Dos For Current Week:*
   * Run the following models:
      * LSTM with differential privacy and small spacy English model
      * Transformer with no DP and large Bert model
      * All Transformer models with differential Privacy
   * Start explaining the task and structure in the Theses
   * Start the next Task
