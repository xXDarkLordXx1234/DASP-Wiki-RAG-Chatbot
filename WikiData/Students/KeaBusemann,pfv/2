---+!! 23.04. - 29.04.

This week I have been setting up the following paired metrics:

BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, TER, MoverScore, SentBERT

For the BLEU score I've used two different options: the concrete one and a smoothing function. Three metaphors in the dataset had zero n-grams, which led to a score of 0.0. With the smoothing funtion this can be avoided, but the scores are in general higher than the not smoothed ones.
Concerning the MoverScore I had to run the model on my CPU, because the Intel GPU doesn't support this as far as I know.
For the SentBERT embeddings I computed the cosine similarity.

Additionally, I started researching Perplexity, more on that is following next week.
