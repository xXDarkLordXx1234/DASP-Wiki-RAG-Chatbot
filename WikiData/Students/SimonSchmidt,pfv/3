*Supervisor*: M.Sc. Tilman Beck 

*Start Date*: 12.04.2021

*Mid-Term Presentation Date*: 12.07.2021

*Final Presentation Date*: 21.09.2021 

*End Date*: 12.10.2021 [To be finalised by Informatik Pr√ºfungskommission]

---++++ *20.04.2021-27.04.2021*
---++ Progress
   * Tested different thresholds for deciding whether multiple references should be selected
      * Threshold slightly improves task 1A sentence overlap, but reduces Rouge score (from 0.139 to 0.045)
      * Threshold greatly improves task 1B performance from 0.170 to 0.375 (both F1 micro)
   * Took a look at downloading ACL ARC and Pubmed RCT full texts

---++ Encountered Problems
   * Had to restructure training/validation data for task 1A and retrain model for threshold tests
   * Retrained model performance is slightly worse than previous (likely due to small changes in the data splits)
   * Predicted probabilities vary and are extremely close on the validation data, hard thresholds had bad results
   * Decided to use a portion of the highest probability reference as threshold, e.g. if the probability of a reference is within 0.1% of the highest probability it is selected too
   * The [[https://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/][ACL ARC page]] appears to be offline

---++ Next Steps
   * Determine how many articles in Pubmed RCT are freely available
   * Write tool to automatically crawl those articles
   * Possibly get ACL ARC papers via Github if the site stays offline
