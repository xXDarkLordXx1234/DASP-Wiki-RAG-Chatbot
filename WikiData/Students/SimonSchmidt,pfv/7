---++++ *27.04.2021-04.05.2021*
---++ Progress
   * Able to get most section headers in cleaned ACL ARC using regex
   * Can remove page numbers from cleaned ACL ARC
   * Found a way to distinguish (most) numbered lists from section headers
   * Structured cleaned ACL ARC into pairs of section header and text for each section
   * Trained CSAbstruct
   * The Open Access subset of PubMedCentral contains 13978 articles from the PubMed-RCT dataset

---++ Encountered Problems
   * Section names are not standardized except for "Abstract" and "Introduction". As a result, separating methods from results and previous works can be difficult.
     Especially since "Methods" doesn't seem to appear as a header in most papers.
   * Regex can't reliably distinguish between section headers and numbered lists or beginning with specific numbers in general
   * Section headers are sometimes split into two or more lines; solution can result in errors in specific lines
   * CSAbstruct training did not work out of the box
   * PubMedCentral [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/about/copyright/][does not allow bulk downloads of articles except for a specific subset]]

---++ Next Steps
   * Create structure from parsed file content

---++++ *20.04.2021-27.04.2021*
---++ Progress
   * Tested different thresholds for deciding whether multiple references should be selected
      * Threshold slightly improves task 1A sentence overlap, but reduces Rouge score (from 0.139 to 0.045)
      * Threshold greatly improves task 1B performance from 0.170 to 0.375 (both F1 micro)
   * Took a look at downloading ACL ARC and Pubmed RCT full texts

---++ Encountered Problems
   * Had to restructure training/validation data for task 1A and retrain model for threshold tests
   * Retrained model performance is slightly worse than previous (likely due to small changes in the data splits)
   * Predicted probabilities vary and are extremely close on the validation data, hard thresholds had bad results
   * Decided to use a portion of the highest probability reference as threshold, e.g. if the probability of a reference is within 0.1% of the highest probability it is selected too
   * The [[https://acl-arc.comp.nus.edu.sg/][ACL ARC page]] appears to be offline

---++ Next Steps
   * Determine how many articles in Pubmed RCT are freely available
   * Write tool to automatically crawl those articles
   * Possibly get ACL ARC papers via Github if the site stays offline
