---++ 04 Apr 2013
*Attendees*: lb, tz, rr
   * Transponder is set up for A326 (D017 should be activated too)
   * New meeting date: *Mo. 11 am*
   * DKPro: Hint: Every AnalysisComponent implements collectionProcessComplete
   * Error message analysis:
      * rr: Data analysis: I've used DKPro to generate statistics (word and sentence diversity) and paired sentences based on an edit distance (Levenshtein) below 10.
      * tz: Paired sentences (that rr generated) are soft clusters
      * Try to find better clusters using (for instance): EditDistance on words, NGramOverlap or similar measures
      * Plagiarism detection is similar: Read papers about plagiarism detection!

*Attendees*: lb, rr
   * lb: There are three construction sites: DKPro (programming), literature work and data analysis
      * You should focus on literature work and data analysis first
   * lb: Summarize your literature work
   * lb: Do some data analysis, e.g. lexical diversity, 'how many times occurs the same sentence?' etc.
   * lb: Check out the similarity package (can be used without DKPro)
