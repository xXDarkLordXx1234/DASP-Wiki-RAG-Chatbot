*Current state*
   * Virtuoso running on local machine with SPARQL endpoint and [[https://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/about][WordNet 3.1]]
   * Full text search is working
   * Multiple knowledge graphs can be imported and simultaneously queried by defining Graph IRIs for each
   * Waiting for VMServer to be deployed

*Open questions/tasks*
   * Since Wikidata is quite large, we need to reduce its size for performant queries:
      * Tool to filter languages and properties, etc.: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Toolkit/Client
      * Config-datei anlegen:
         * Only german and english
         * Only use properties that are not on the [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/property_blacklist.txt][blacklist]] (remove from [[https://github.com/maxlath/wikidata-cli/blob/master/docs/read_operations.md#wd-props][list of all properties]])
   * Investigate Entity Linkers until VMServer is available:
      * See agenda from 12.10.2018
      * Check which KBs support Wikipedia/Wikidata QIDs (on which the Entity Linker will be trained on)
      * Do we need separate Entity Linkers for KBs that do not support QIDs?

*Current state*
   * Virtuoso running on local machine with SPARQL endpoint and WordNet 3.1

*Open questions/tasks*
   * Is it possible to use other query languages (SQL, CIPHER, etc.)?
   * How to enable full text search? (https://github.com/dotnetrdf/dotnetrdf/wiki/UserGuide-Full-Text-Querying-With-SPARQL)
   * How is it possible to use multiple knowledge bases in one Virtuoso endpoint?
   * Provide detailed documentation for installation and configuration

*Organizational*
   * Sign contract, intellectual proprty statement, task descriptions
   * Mandatory meetings on Tuesdays at 11:30 in B002
   * Thesis template und Presentation template: https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Students/InformationenFuerDiplomanden

*Proposed/Discussed next steps (Overview)*
   1 Work into Virtuoso (document all steps)
      2 Build a minimal working sample by  installing Virtuoso, adding e.g. WordNet (specs for virtuoso KB server: https://docs.google.com/document/d/17gru5AApGwa-F7_4gZ_adMjlmBUYviD6oynSgiz0gMM/edit)
      3 Add a SPARQL endpoint for WordNet/Virtuoso (check functionality by comparing it to official WordNet SPAQRL endpoint)
      4 Find out how to add multiple KBs with their own endpoints (is a combined endpoint possible?)
   2 Entity linker
      3 Find out which entity linkers can be used for the proposed KBs and how they work (is a SPAQRL endpoint sufficient?), e.g. from:
         *     Unsupervised Entity Linking with Abstract Meaning Representation, ACL16 
         *     CoType: Joint Typing of Entities and Relations with Knowledge Bases, WWW17 
         *     Fast and Space-Efficient Entity Linking in Queries, WSDM15 
         *     Tagme: on-the-fly annotation of short text fragments (by Wikipedia entities), CIKM10 
         *     Local and Global Algorithms for Disambiguation to Wikipedia (Wikifier), ACL11 
         *     DBpedia Spotlight, iSemantics13 
      4 Test entity linkers with Virtuoso endpoint
