---+ Experimental results
   * Translation with Universal Dictionary yields low results
      * Only ~500 words from !OpinionFinder were translated (out of ~8200 entries) by using the "full" UD dictionary
      * Only ~1000 words were translated by using both the "full" and the "light" UD dictionary
         * See ElifLexicalResources for further information

   * Translation of OpinionFinder lexicon with self-written parser for Wiktionary yields following results: 
      * Number of translated words 2052 out of 8221 total. Not translated: 6169
      * Of those not translated
         * 1273 because lack of Part-of-Speech
         * Many more because lack of Translations entries (see .ods document)
      * *Questions:*
         1 Do all the OpinionFinder entries exist in the English Wiktionary? you should look for the lemma form of the ones with stemmed=y.

   * Bootstrapping
      * Testing with 10 words yielded very good results
         * List of 780 words after 3 passes, approximately 600 after repeat words have been deleted.
         * Rare cases of wrong results, such as "Gutshof" as a synonym for "gut"
      * *Questions*: 
         1 Do you use only synonomy in the bootstrapping process? Why not other lexical relationships?
         1 Where did you find starting seed terms? You can use the translation of Turney seed terms. 
         1 How do you stop the bootstrapping process? No substantial gain in the list size. 
         1 Comparison to bootstrapping from !GermaNet
         1 Comparison to manually pruned list created from the GermaNet.
