   * Status Report(RH): What have you done?
      * captured the three ideas, that emerged from the discussions between of IH, CS, RH, in short presentations:
         * the 'Article Debate' approach: let users select text in articles of publishers and add their arguments pro or contra, with enhanced Gamification aspects
         * the 'How well do you know your friends' approach: guess who of your friends this argument originates from
         * the 'Based on a premise, can you guess the direction?' approach: guess if the author is pro or contra a certain topic, based on one provided premise only
      * initially tested existing, well known 'gamified' apps, such as Duolingo, Runstastic, Zombierun
      * searched for potential show-stoppers in the three game concepts
         * Bootstrapping: present in all approaches: we need an initial pool of debating questions, corresponding arguments, and existing users to make the game gun from the very first day of the launch _(Thoughts: As long as there won't come up a brilliant idea during the thesis how to let the users themselves create data before they start playing it, we probably will have to produce initial data on our own, manually. Idea: every user will have to produce ONE+ argument during a short intro tutorial before (s)he can start playing the game)_
         * Typing on Smartphones: Although there is a dictation feature in current smartphones OSs, it may be arduous to produce contents on a small, virtual keyboard _(Thoughts: a) the template will simplify the creation process. b) a Desktop browser version may help for those who really suffer. c) the OS dictation feature works quite well with simple texts (no numbers contained, etc.).)_
         * lack of engaging friends: the 'How well do you know your friends' idea highly depends on the fact that enough of your Social Media friends are also using the app _(Thoughts: Do not only guess your friends, but also guess properties of unknown authors, such as gender, age, home country. This will reduce the fun factor, but makes the concept robust against lack of user data)_
       * Idea (IH, CS) to merge the two 'guessing' game ideas into one single app: since both approaches share the same data models, combining the two will reduce the impact of the individual problems of the ideas. RH: Great idea to combine them, which is similar to the idea to also guess unknown author's properties. Combining all the concepts will introduce more variation in the game and, thus, entertain the user even more.
   * Status Report(RH): What will you do?
      * further elaborate risks of the current concept
      * check which and how educational apps have been promoted by Apple in their AppStore(s) recently
      * look up existing apps in this domain
      * elaborate research questions in all technical views of the whole concept to enhance the research value of the thesis
      * search for Backend-as-a-service services
      * search for cross-platform application frameworks
   * Status Report(RH): What's in your way?
      * externally: my upcoming job interview
   * @todo(student):
      * finally get a signed overview of my grades in the Pr√ºfungsamt
