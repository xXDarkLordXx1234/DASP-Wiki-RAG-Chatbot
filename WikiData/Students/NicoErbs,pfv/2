-- Main.CigdemToprak - 11 May 2009

Masterthesis started on 4th of May.

Forums, as well as any Web 2.0 platforms, offer anybody an excellent way to express their opininion or distribute suggestions. In this Masterhesis my aim is to develop a system that automatically analyses if an entry in a forum is expressing an opinion (subjective) or is presenting facts (objective). Additionally it should measure if the opinion is either positive, neutral or negative (polarity).
