---+ Bootstrapping Experimental Results

---++ Goals
   * Creating subjectivity lexicons by using a seed list and expanding it via lexical semantic relations such as synonymy and antonymy. 
---++ Related Work
---++ Methods
---++ Results
   * Testing with 10 words yielded very good results
      * List of 780 words after 3 passes, approximately 600 after repeat words have been deleted.
      * Rare cases of wrong results, such as "Gutshof" as a synonym for "gut"
   * *Questions*: 
      1 Do you use only synonomy in the bootstrapping process? Why not other lexical relationships?
      1 Distinguish polarity of the source seed term. Syn relation preserves the polarity, ant. relation switches etc. 
      1 Where did you find starting seed terms? You can use the translation of Turney seed terms. 
      1 How do you stop the bootstrapping process? No substantial gain in the list size. Refer to "simple expand" algorithm in Esuli's paper.
      1 Comparison to bootstrapping from !GermaNet
      1 Comparison to manually pruned list created from the !GermaNet. 
   * *Answers*:
      1 Including Antonymy in the bootstrapping process gave very good results. Hyponymy and Hypernymy however resulted in very low quality word lists with words like "Autonummer" and "Vorentscheid" being included. 
      1 Included polarity now
      1 TODO
      1 I've experimented with various methods, including fixed number of iterations or stopping the process if the increase of the word list is less than 10%. 
         * Durchlauf 0, Positive Words Size 37, Negative Words Size 60
         * Durchlauf 1, Positive Words Size 83, Negative Words Size 150
         * Durchlauf 2, Positive Words Size 205, Negative Words Size 345
         * Durchlauf 3, Positive Words Size 515, Negative Words Size 689
         * Durchlauf 4, Positive Words Size 1092, Negative Words Size 1289
         * Durchlauf 5, Positive Words Size 2086, Negative Words Size 2247
         * Durchlauf 6, Positive Words Size 3652, Negative Words Size 3670
         * Durchlauf 7, Positive Words Size 5910, Negative Words Size 6008
         * Had to abort after that, as my slow laptop could not finish the calculations for the next iteration in an hour

---++ Bootstrapping with JWKTL (addition to the above)
         * recent changes include manual input in the first two passes to eliminate non-subjective words (like "Gutshof" as synonym for "gut")
