---+!! Meetings

---++ 09.11.2016
   * New ideas:
      * Application of IMMC for text segmentation: http://www.mirlab.org/conference_papers/International_Conference/ICASSP%201998/pdf/author/ic982335.pdf
      * HDM-HMM: Potential paper (Side-work)

---++ 02.11.2016
   * Presentation:
      * Outline: merge *Done*
      * References for the pictures *Done*
      * HDP: example hdp vs lda
      * Link from HDP to HMM: order of observation (LDA bag of words) *Done*
      * HDP-HMM: motivating Example? HDP-HMM WSI (experiment results or the idea)
      * IMMC and motivation: swap *Done*
      * Scalability: add more detail on dataset and experiment, Goal/motivation + requirement for the scalable model
      * AVParallel: describe super cluster
      * Add new slide: question, application for nlp
      * Add new slide: about the rest of the work
      * result of immc for wsi ?
      * try to use the idea of "Word Sense Disambiguation using HMM Tagger" as an example of immc for wsi
   * Writing:
      * also add experiments in here, e.g. immc for wsd
   * Run IMMC for WSI/WSD or ESD: *priority*
      * HDP-HMM/IMMC for WSI: for long documents.
   * Implementation:
      * Scalable IMMC
---++ 28.10.2016
   * Presentation:
      * Eliminate some details (e.g. math stuff) *I tried keep the ones*
      * Add overview about scalability (high level view) *Done*
      * Motivation IMMC (FB sample) *Done*
      * Scalability: Add AV-DP result from matlab implementation *Done*
   * Writing:
      * More explanation on AV IMMC *Done*
      * Inference *Partially, DPMM is done*
      * Visualization (for stick breaking process *done*, also graphical models *done*)
      * Organization of sections
      * Summerize the spliting and merging steps as well as clustering (From last week)
   * Run IMMC for WSI/WSD or ESD: *priority*
      * HDP-HMM/HDP for WSI: for long documents. *Experiment with HDP for WSI*
   * Implementation:
      * Scalable IMMC

---++ 18.10.2016
   * Prepare presentation slides *Please checkout Presentation/Mid-term presentation.pdf, Still working on it*
   * Requirement for distributed platform
      * A single server with multiple cores *[Currently using google cloud (free for 2 months) 1CPU 8Cores 7GB mem]*
      * investigate existing options (hadoop, spark, tension flow)
      * Check out free plan on amazon cloud *[Applied for it, wait for approval.]*
   * Prepare report on model in more detail and align with implementation *Please checkout Writing/Template/UKPThesisTemplate.pdf. Not quite done yet*
   * Summerize the spliting and merging steps as well as clustering 
   * evaluation: 
      * try with exterme values different in each cluster => *got better, used 30,000 data, 78%-94% correctly identified (depends on the dataset)*
      * try prediction task

---++ 12.10.2016

   * Reviewing scalability papers for HDPs and adapting to IMMC
      * Proposed method uses a Gibbs' sampler with auxiliary variables
   * Implementing scalable distributed IMMC
   * Tasks to do for next week:
      * Report on the method -- put a description into the thesis template
      * Continue with implementation of distributed IMMC
      * Produce an outline of the mid-term presentation
      * Update UKP Wiki page
      * Presentation info (see [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/view/Students/HamidZafarPresentations][presentation page]])
      * Computation resources!
