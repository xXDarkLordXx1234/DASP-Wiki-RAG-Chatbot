---+!! Meetings
---++ 18.12.2016
   * In visualization, Do I take the max duration or average over it for multiple run? What to do with proc that finishes early?

   * affinity clustering (eeg.: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AffinityPropagation.html  http://scikit-   learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.cluster)
   * Record the intermediate results like finding super cluster by using different approaches

      * compare the scalable immc to immc: f1 and time *Done*
   * evaluation of HDP-HMM and HDP on 100 papers of NIPS *Done*
      * perplexity (but might not show the advantage of HDP-HMM) for slide 18  *Skipped*
