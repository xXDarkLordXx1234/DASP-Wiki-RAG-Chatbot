---+!! Meetings

---++ 28.10.2016
   * Presentation:
      * Eliminate some details (e.g. math stuff) *I tried keep the ones*
      * Add overview about scalability (high level view) *Done*
      * Motivation IMMC (FB sample) *Done*
      * Scalability: Add AV-DP result from matlab implementation *Done*
   * Writing:
      * More explanation on AV IMMC *Done*
      * Inference *Partially, DPMM is done*
      * Visualization (for stick breaking process *done*, also graphical models *done*)
      * Organization of sections
      * Summerize the spliting and merging steps as well as clustering (From last week)
   * Run IMMC for WSI/WSD or ESD: *priority*
      * HDP-HMM/HDP for WSI: for long documents. *Experiment with HDP for WSI*
   * Implementation:
      * Scalable IMMC

---++ 18.10.2016
   * Prepare presentation slides *Please checkout Presentation/Mid-term presentation.pdf, Still working on it*
   * Requirement for distributed platform
      * A single server with multiple cores *[Currently using google cloud (free for 2 months) 1CPU 8Cores 7GB mem]*
      * investigate existing options (hadoop, spark, tension flow)
      * Check out free plan on amazon cloud *[Applied for it, wait for approval.]*
   * Prepare report on model in more detail and align with implementation *Please checkout Writing/Template/UKPThesisTemplate.pdf. Not quite done yet*
   * Summerize the spliting and merging steps as well as clustering 
   * evaluation: 
      * try with exterme values different in each cluster => *got better, used 30,000 data, 78%-94% correctly identified (depends on the dataset)*
      * try prediction task

---++ 12.10.2016

   * Reviewing scalability papers for HDPs and adapting to IMMC
      * Proposed method uses a Gibbs' sampler with auxiliary variables
   * Implementing scalable distributed IMMC
   * Tasks to do for next week:
      * Report on the method -- put a description into the thesis template
      * Continue with implementation of distributed IMMC
      * Produce an outline of the mid-term presentation
      * Update UKP Wiki page
      * Presentation info (see [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/view/Students/HamidZafarPresentations][presentation page]])
      * Computation resources!
