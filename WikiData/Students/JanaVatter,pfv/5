---+!! Thesis: Exploring Training Strategies for cQA Retrieval Tasks

   * *Pr√ºfungsordnung*: PO 2015
   * *Start date*: 01.11.2018
   * *End date*: 02.05.2019
   * *Talks*: to be scheduled


*Goals*:
   * Setting up and performing a number of experiments on multiple datasets to compare the different training strategies on the example of the question retrieval task and the RCNN model
   * Implementation of training methods in existing experimental software
   * Simulating low-resource scenarios for a more realistic comparison of the different training methods in practical scenarios
   * Performing an error analysis

---+!! Tasks
   * [TODO] Run RCNN on AskUbuntu with standard hyperparameters
   * [TODO] Report AUC for transfer datasets + compare with in-domain scores from paper
   * [TODO] Upload preprocessing code to gitlab

---+!! Reports

---++ KW 47
