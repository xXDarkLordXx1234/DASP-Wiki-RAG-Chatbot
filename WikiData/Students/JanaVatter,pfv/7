---+!! Thesis: Exploring Training Strategies for cQA Retrieval Tasks

   * *Pr√ºfungsordnung*: PO 2015
   * *Start date*: 01.11.2018
   * *End date*: 02.05.2019
   * *Talks*: to be scheduled


*Goals*:
   * Setting up and performing a number of experiments on multiple datasets to compare the different training strategies on the example of the question retrieval task and the RCNN model
   * Implementation of training methods in existing experimental software
   * Simulating low-resource scenarios for a more realistic comparison of the different training methods in practical scenarios
   * Performing an error analysis

---+!! Tasks
   * [TODO] Look for better hyperparameters
   * [TODO] Find out which encoder component they use in Domain Transfer
   * [TODO] Why are the values from the sprint dataset worse than from other datasets? 
   * [TODO] Reasons why results are worse than results from direct transfer
   * [DONE] Upload AUC Code to gitlab

---+!! Reports

---++ 06.12.2018
   * Ran Pre-Training+RCNN with hyperparameters from RCNN Paper
   * Used AskUbuntu dataset from RCNN Paper and several datasets from Domain Transfer Paper
   * Results are better than BM25 from DT Paper, but worse than direct transfer
   * Values from sprint dataset aren't really good

Details ([[%ATTACHURLPATH%/Report02.pdf][pdf]])

---++ 28.11.2018
   * Preprocessed data from Domain Transfer Paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.02255.pdf)
   * Ran RCNN Model on the AskUbuntu dataset (https://github.com/taolei87/askubuntu) and datasets from the Domain Transfer Paper
   * Implemented AUC
