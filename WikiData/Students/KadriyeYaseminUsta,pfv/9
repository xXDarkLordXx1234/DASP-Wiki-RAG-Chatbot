---++++ *Masters Thesis* : Visualizing Argument Aspects in Cluster Networks 

*Supervisor*: Dr.-Ing. Johannes Daxenberger     
*Co-Supervisor*: M.Sc. Tilman Beck


*Start Date*: 16-MAR-2020 

*Mid-Term Presentation Date*: 23-JUNE-2020

*Final Presentation Date*: 01-SEP-2020  

*End Date*: 14-SEP-2020

---++++ *9.JUNE.2020*
*Meeting Decisions:*

   * 
  
*TO-DO List:*
   
   * 

---++++ *28.MAY.2020 - 9.JUNE.2020*
*Decisions:*
  
   * Input: Clusters of arguments
   * Output: A readable cluster visualization
   * Start creating a baseline with Triframes-Triclusters algorithm (https://github.com/uhh-lt/triframes) 
   * Note: Cluster API has a maximum capacity of 500 arguments.

*Status:*

   * Literature Review: Checked the feedback.
   * Still working on grammar and reading flow.
   * Searched recent studies on how to visualize clusters, how to label clusters (Found ANCA: Attributed Network Clustering Algorithm)
   * Implementation: Created new offline-results with 125 documents that have 492 arguments. The results contain 36 clusters of 477 arguments with threshold 0.5, 783 aspects.
   * Setup a new Linux machine for Triframes and set up the dependencies of Triframes to test the results.
   * To preprocess the input(arguments) Watset algorithm is also used. 
   * I got a result of basic test data. I hope to get results before our meeting on 9 June.
   * I created two graphs: One is showing the top 5 most frequently used aspects in a cluster. The other shows the top 5 arguments that have the highest confidence in a cluster.
   * As a baseline, I created an aspect graph too.
   * I enhanced APIcaller with parametrizing which API to call.
   * I improved the graph creation by taking data from API and preprocessing methods. (It was kinda hardcoded before)
  
*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Search cluster visualizing, labeling, and methods for ensuring readability
   * Implementation: Enhanced the basic graph creation mechanism.
   * Implementation: Setup Watset and get results
 
---++++ *19.MAY.2020 - 28.MAY.2020*
*Decisions:*
  
   * Use search and cluster API with the threshold of 0,4-0,5 and minimum 200 arguments.

*Status:*

   * Implementation: A basic graph is ready.
   * Literature Review: 2nd draft submitted.
   * Literature Review: Still working on grammar and reading flow.
  
*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Gonna get feedback
   * RoadMap: Send a list of methods that I want to use for the thesis. (until Tuesday)
   * Implementation: Implement a cluster graph that shows the top k most aspects.

---++++ *27.APR.2020*
*Status:*

   * Literature Review: Checking "short-text clustering" articles
   * Implementation: Basic word cloud created
  
*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Submit 2nd draft
   * Implementation: Add distance function and connect the JSON input file
   
---++++ *07.APR.2020 - 21.APR.2020*
*Decisions:*

   *  We donâ€™t need a vote from the ethics committee.

*Status:*
   * Setup: Python Flask and Vue.js integrated (a primary example website implemented)
   * Setup: Implemented a basic API caller script that can access to search, cluster, aspect, and classify API and saves the output as a result. Also, after a search, it adds the arguments to cluster and aspect API as parameters.
   * Setup: The outputs JSON are saved to my local for testing the functionality.
   * Setup: ArgumenText UI codes checked and planned to integrate basic dashboard to my working place
   * Working on: Create a basic ArgumenText dashboard UI for adding a section for graph
   * Literature Review: 1st draft sent and got the feedback. Working on feedback.
   * Literature Review: Still reading the new suggestions  

*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Submit 2nd draft
   * Implementation: Create a basic playground with the data. (Basic visualization of the network)

---++++ *14.APR.2020*
*Status:*
   * Setup: API - got results from API calls
   * Setup: Flask and Vue.js
   * Literature Review: Still working on

*TO-DO List:*

   * Integrate Flask and Vue.js
   * Create a JSON parser for API results

---++++ *31.MAR.2020 - 07.APR.2020*
*Decisions:*

   * Submit Literature Review as soon as possible
   * Use S-BERT technique for clustering on ArgumenText

*Status:*
   * Setup: Registered to ArgumenText
   * Setup: Gitlab cloned to local and committed the folder structure (codes + thesis)
   * Setup: Successfully connected to lisa and slurm (VPN setup success)
   * Report: Main writing plan created
   * Literature Review: Still working on
   * Literature Review: Created a separate environment for the thesis on Mendeley and added the reference information.   

*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Finish
   * Setup APIs


---++++ *16.MAR.2020 - 31.MAR.2020*
*Status:*
   
   * The meeting delayed to 7.APR.
   * Registration form of ArgumenText could not found.
   * Not noteworthy progress
   * Registered Tu-CAN


---++++ *3.MAR.2020 - 16.MAR.2020*
*Decisions:*

   * Start implementing with ArgumenText Dashboard
   * Setup the APIs and be sure they are working then implement functionality on local input.

*Status after the Two Last Week:*
   
   * Report: Setup Latex template and filled elementary information
   * Literature Review: Finished reading and summarizing papers 
   * Setup Mendeley and added references
