*End Date*: 14-SEP-2020

---++++ *30.JUNE.2020*
*Meeting Decisions:*

*Status:*
   *  Mid-Term Presentation done
   *  Solved Docker issue (ADU presentation [Lenz et al. 2020 article])
   *  Corrected aspect finding algorithm and created new graphs
   *  Lowercased aspects and arguments
   *  Implemented basic postprocessing on the selection of aspects.
   *  Started to graph drawing framework for visualizing different layout types.
   
*TO-DO List:*

---++++ *16.JUNE.2020*
*Meeting Decisions:*
   
   * Discussed how to implement an evaluation metric, F1-score, to the system. We decided to use pairwise F1-score comparison like ACL article.
   * Decided to use annotated ACL data to evaluate the system.
   * <b>Optimization Suggestion</b>: Aggregation of aspects in the cluster is suggested (using Levenshtein distance or BERT [which uses cosine similarity]).
   * <b>Layout Suggestion</b>: Highlighting area of a cluster may be more useful than showing as dummy node.

*Status:*

   * Showed the graphs (top 5 most frequent terms with/out stopwords, top 5 highest confidence arguments, top 5 most used aspects)
   * Explained triframes algorithm and docker problem
   * Presentation feedback is discussed
    
*TO-DO List:*
   
   *  Submit 2nd draft until <i>Friday (19.06.2020)</i>
   *  Visualize Triframes outputs
   *  Solve Docker issue (ADU presentation [Lenz et al. 2020 article])
   *  Correct aspect finding algorithm (The output aspects are sorted according to the input)
   *  Lowercase, lemmatization  and stemming of aspects
   *  Implement basic postprocessing on the selection of aspects. 

---++++ *28.MAY.2020 - 16.JUNE.2020*
*Decisions:*
  
   * Input: Clusters of arguments
   * Output: A readable cluster visualization
   * Start creating a baseline with Triframes-Triclusters algorithm (https://github.com/uhh-lt/triframes) 
   * Note: Cluster API has a maximum capacity of 500 arguments.

*Status:*

   * Literature Review: Checked the feedback.
   * Still working on grammar and reading flow.
   * Searched recent studies on how to visualize clusters, how to label clusters (Found ANCA: Attributed Network Clustering Algorithm)
   * Implementation: Created new offline-results with 125 documents that have 492 arguments. The results contain 36 clusters of 477 arguments with threshold 0.5, 783 aspects.
   * Setup a new Linux machine for Triframes and set up the dependencies of Triframes to test the results.
   * To preprocess the input(arguments) Watset algorithm is also used. 
   * I got a result of basic test data. I hope to get results before our meeting on 9 June.
   * I created two graphs: One is showing the top 5 most frequently used aspects in a cluster. The other shows the top 5 arguments that have the highest confidence in a cluster.
   * As a baseline, I created an aspect graph too.
   * I enhanced APIcaller with parametrizing which API to call.
   * I improved the graph creation by taking data from API and preprocessing methods. (It was kinda hardcoded before)
  
*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Search cluster visualizing, labeling, and methods for ensuring readability
   * Implementation: Enhanced the basic graph creation mechanism.
   * Implementation: Setup Watset and get results
 
---++++ *19.MAY.2020 - 28.MAY.2020*
*Decisions:*
  
   * Use search and cluster API with the threshold of 0,4-0,5 and minimum 200 arguments.

*Status:*

   * Implementation: A basic graph is ready.
   * Literature Review: 2nd draft submitted.
   * Literature Review: Still working on grammar and reading flow.
  
*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Gonna get feedback
   * RoadMap: Send a list of methods that I want to use for the thesis. (until Tuesday)
   * Implementation: Implement a cluster graph that shows the top k most aspects.

---++++ *27.APR.2020*
*Status:*

   * Literature Review: Checking "short-text clustering" articles
   * Implementation: Basic word cloud created
  
*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Submit 2nd draft
   * Implementation: Add distance function and connect the JSON input file
   
---++++ *07.APR.2020 - 21.APR.2020*
*Decisions:*

   *  We donâ€™t need a vote from the ethics committee.

*Status:*
   * Setup: Python Flask and Vue.js integrated (a primary example website implemented)
   * Setup: Implemented a basic API caller script that can access to search, cluster, aspect, and classify API and saves the output as a result. Also, after a search, it adds the arguments to cluster and aspect API as parameters.
   * Setup: The outputs JSON are saved to my local for testing the functionality.
   * Setup: ArgumenText UI codes checked and planned to integrate basic dashboard to my working place
   * Working on: Create a basic ArgumenText dashboard UI for adding a section for graph
   * Literature Review: 1st draft sent and got the feedback. Working on feedback.
   * Literature Review: Still reading the new suggestions  

*TO-DO List:*
   
   * Literature Review: Submit 2nd draft
   * Implementation: Create a basic playground with the data. (Basic visualization of the network)

---++++ *14.APR.2020*
*Status:*
   * Setup: API - got results from API calls
   * Setup: Flask and Vue.js
   * Literature Review: Still working on
