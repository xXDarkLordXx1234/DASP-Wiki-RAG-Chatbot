---+!! Agendas
---++++ Master Thesis of Rouven RÃ¶hrig
This page contains the agendas of the weekly meetings.

---++++ Agenda for 27 May 2013, 11 am
   * Discussion of the implemented cluster algorithm
      * The clustering has been implemented as discussed last week
      * A 'centroid' is selected by using the most similar sentence within a cluster 
      * A pipeline has been implemented as discussed last week
         * However, similar centroids are proposed instead of the most frequent sentence.
   * Open question:
      * My pipeline is using a resource (src/main/resource). When I build a jar, the resources cannot be resolved!?
   * Planned tasks for this week (27. - 02.06.)
      * Correcting the maven packaging
      * LaTeX investigations...
      * Writing some thesis texts
      * tbd
      * (If time remains, try to generate glossary resource)
      * (If time remains, integrating glossary like resource)
   * (sorry for the late agenda)

---++++ Agenda for 21 May 2013, 11 am
   * Status of the (minimal) system
   * Discussion of planned algorithms
      * Strategy for the problem identification
         * Current approach idea:
            1 Find/select the most similar cluster for a given sentence (using Text similarity measures)
            2 If the given sentence is not the most frequent one of the selected cluster, return diff to most frequent sentence
      * Strategy for the problem correction
         * Current approach idea:
            1 (same as above) 
            2 (same as above) 
            3 Propose most frequent sentence of the most similar cluster
   * General question:
      * I've corrected the 'Denglish' in the thesis template (I hope this is okay)
   * (Other work done (fyi):)
      * System infrastructure implemented (including proper tests)
      * Correction module for spelling mistakes implemented (including identification and simple proposals)
      * System is being used by the simple GUI (the one I've shown last meeting)
      * Some thesis chapters started/written (or added from existing text files)
   * Planned tasks for this week (21. - 27.05.)
      * Implementation of the planned clustering algorithm (see above)
      * LaTeX investigations...
      * Writing some thesis texts
      * (If time remains, try to generate glossary resource)
      * (If time remains, integrating glossary like resource)
   * (sorry for the late agenda)

   * Demo of message editor
   * (Other work done (fyi):)
