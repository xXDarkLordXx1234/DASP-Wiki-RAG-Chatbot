---++ Meeting notes

---+++ 25.05.2018

   * Assumption: Arguments generated by in-house parser are good enough
   * Argument quality still needs to be considered: Sentence length, readability, confidence of parser etc.
   * Filter arguments: Use simpler rules (no annotation for argument quality)
   * Take notes while reviewing related work; needs to be included in thesis
   * Thesis deadline: ~ mid december

---++++ Todo:

   * Take a look at the data (corpora from Misra et al, UKP corpus).
   * Create a mockup on paper how the HIT for argument similarity is going to look like
   * Transform mockup for Best-Worst scaling
   * Literature review / related work on:
      * Preprocessing: How arguments are preprocessed, how interesting pairs are selected
      * Pairwise annotation for assessing arg sim
      * Best-Worst scaling
      * Habernal Gurevych 2016 (annotation method)
      * Preference/ranking based methods for crowdsourcing/annotating similarity
