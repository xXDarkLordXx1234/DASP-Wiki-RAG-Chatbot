   ---+ From Wikipedia Action Taxonomy to Revision Categories

---++ Types of Wikipedia Action Taxonomy

In Paper [1] we see the Wikipedia Action Taxonomy. The leaves of the graph are possible categories for the revision classification.

---++ Categories

From the action taxonomy we can identify 4 main categories: Vandalism, Revert, Text, Format. Each as a number of subclasses.

---+++ Vandalism
   * Blanking
   * large-scala editing
   * <strike>link spam</strike>
   * <strike>image attack</strike>
   * graffiti
   * <strike>misinformation</strike>
   * irregular formatting

---+++ Revert
   * Revert due vandalism
   * Revert due edit war
   * <strike>Revert due unsourced</strike>
   * <strike>Revert due to user test</strike>

---+++ Text
   * link internal
   * link external
   * image add
   * reference
   * spell
   * grammer
   * rephrase
   * section
   * relocate section
   * add/change information
   * <strike>summarize</strike>

---+++ Format
   * html/css
   * wiki template

---++ How to find the categories

---+++ Vandalism

---++++ Blanking
"If the new revision was at least 90% smaller than the average length of the page" [1]

---++++ Large-scale editing
"If the size of new edits (insertion and change) was twice as large as the median value of the length of all edits in the previous diff history" [1]

---++++ Graffiti
"threshold to the ratio of upper-case letters or the maximum length of a word in the new edit"

---++++ Irregular Formatting
*TODO*

---+++ Revert
Reverts can be detected if the new revision r<literal><sub>i</sub></literal> has the same content as revision r<literal><sub>i-j</sub></literal> for 0 &lt; j &lt; i-1. In most cases j=i-2.

---+++ Revert due vandalism
If r<literal><sub>j</sub></literal> is a revert of verion r<literal><sub>i</sub></literal>, a version between r<literal><sub>j</sub></literal> and r<literal><sub>i</sub></literal> must categorize with vandalism

---+++ Revert due edit test
Check the version between r<literal><sub>j</sub></literal> and r<literal><sub>i</sub></literal> for deletetion and inserting of the same content. *TODO*

---+++ Text
---++++ Link internal
The wikipedia parser can export internal (external) links from each version. Than we only need to build a diff of these to lists.

---++++ Link external
_see link internal_ 

---++++ Image add
The wikipedia parser can export all image, videos and audio content. With this information we can again build a diff.

---++++ Reference
Create list of references in both revision and compare them (not in wikipedia parser found)

---++++ Spell

   * Find token that changed
   * use DKPro UGD Spellchecker 

---++++ Grammer
*TODO*

---++++ Rephrase
*TODO*

---++++ Section
*TODO*

---+++ Format
---++++ html / css
*TODO*
---++++ wiki template
*TODO*
