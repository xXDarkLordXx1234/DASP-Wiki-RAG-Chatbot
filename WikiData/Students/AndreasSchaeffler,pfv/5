---++++ *Bachelor Thesis* : GANs for data augmentation

*Start date* :  

*Supervisors*: Pedro Santos, Dr Steffen Eger

---++++ Current Status
   * 06.11.2017:
      * thanks for the suggestions. I read them and took notes on them. Unfortunately, I didn't do more last week.
      * Thanks for the mail concerning the GAN code from Yevgeniy, but it doesn't contain an attachment for me.

---++++ Meeting protocol - 07.11.2017
   * Discussion:
      * Finish related work section soon to get feedback from us
      * Grade should be available by End of April
         * Need to present twice (midterm, final) - so both need to be before End of April
         * Then you have less than 6 months (plus two weeks of holiday/absence)
            * organize your work schedule accordingly
            * you need to work more because you have less time
      * Register within the next 3-4 weeks
      * Purpose of literature reading on data augmentation in NLP:
         * identify good baselines
         * if no good baselines can be identified, go with:
            * self-training
            * Language Model
      * Come to the UKP Meetings on Tuesdays regularly
      * Send us a status report every Monday evening
   * @info(PSa, SE) Points in the agenda:
      * Datasets;
      * Code;
      * Literature review (in case anything new was found) + Writing (templates): [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/pub/Students/InformationenFuerDiplomanden/UKPThesisTemplate.zip]];
         * Template is neither complete nor obligatory, form of the thesis can vary depending on the context...
      * Deadlines:
         * Registration of thesis (inform us);
         * Mid-term presentation: 06th March;
         * Final presentation: 12th Jun.

---++++ Meeting protocol - 24.10.2017
   * Discussed details about multimodal embeddings and the sentence classification tasks
   * Explanation of the pipeline for preprocessing the sentence and document classification datasets
   * Details about administrative issues
   * Expected for next week: literature review on data augmentation for NLP, literature review on GANs (state-of-the-art)
