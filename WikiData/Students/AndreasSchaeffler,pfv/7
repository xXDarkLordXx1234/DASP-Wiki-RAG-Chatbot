---++++ *Bachelor Thesis* : GANs for data augmentation

*Start date* :  

*Supervisors*: Pedro Santos, Dr Steffen Eger

---++++ Current Status
   * 12.11.2017 
      * Done last week
         * I started writing the related work section of the thesis, the PDF of the current version is attached to this page. I also found some additonal papers on data augmentation in NLP and GANs for data augmentation. Their description is included in the related work.
         * I had a look at the 20 Newsgroups and the argumentation mining dataset. The latter looks like a sequence labelling data set, but I guess I'm suppposed to just classify the sentences individually?
         * I was able to connect via ssh, install tensorflow and keras and run tensorflow on the gpu
         * I downloaded the datasets from https://github.com/facebookresearch/SentEval
      * Problems
         * I'm unable to access the following pages ("Access check on UKP.GpuUsagePolicy failed. Action "VIEW": access not allowed on web."): https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/viewauth/UKP/GpuUsagePolicy https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/viewauth/UKP/ServerJobs
         * Extracting some of the SentEval datasets failed because cabextract is not installed on desktop-k40 (I'm not allowed to use sudo, right?)
      * Plans for next week
         * Read about multimodal embeddings and add them to the related work
         * Have a look at the MOSI dataset and the SentEval datasets and write about all datasets in the thesis (in what detail?)
   * 06.11.2017:
      * thanks for the suggestions. I read them and took notes on them. Unfortunately, I didn't do more last week.
      * Thanks for the mail concerning the GAN code from Yevgeniy, but it doesn't contain an attachment for me.

---++++ Meeting protocol - 07.11.2017
   * Discussion:
      * Finish related work section soon to get feedback from us
      * Grade should be available by End of April
         * Need to present twice (midterm, final) - so both need to be before End of April
         * Then you have less than 6 months (plus two weeks of holiday/absence)
            * organize your work schedule accordingly
            * you need to work more because you have less time
      * Register within the next 3-4 weeks
      * Purpose of literature reading on data augmentation in NLP:
         * identify good baselines
         * if no good baselines can be identified, go with:
            * self-training
            * Language Model
      * Come to the UKP Meetings on Tuesdays regularly
      * Send us a status report every Monday evening
      * Start writing as soon as possible, especially the related work section since you have just finished reviewing the literature
      * Fill out an applicable form available here: [[https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/de/studierende/studium/abschlussarbeiten/]]
         * Please hand enrollment form to us.
         * Please send a TuCan printout to us which shows the official deadline to hand in the thesis.
      * Information about the servers: [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/view/UKP/ServerJobs]]
         * Every job has to be scheduled in the server before being run
         * If you need access to other servers, just let us know and we can see what we can do.
         * Information on how to install the libraries in the GPU server: [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/viewauth/DKPro/GpuServer]]
         * Policies and some hints on how to use the GPU server, e.g. important details to pay attention when using tensorflow/keras: [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/viewauth/UKP/GpuUsagePolicy]]
   * @info(PSa, SE) Points in the agenda:
      * Datasets;
      * Code;
      * Literature review (in case anything new was found) + Writing (templates): [[https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/pub/Students/InformationenFuerDiplomanden/UKPThesisTemplate.zip]];
         * Template is neither complete nor obligatory, form of the thesis can vary depending on the context...
      * Deadlines:
         * Registration of thesis (inform us);
         * Mid-term presentation: 06th March;
         * Final presentation: 12th Jun.
      * Change password for your user.

---++++ Meeting protocol - 24.10.2017
   * Discussed details about multimodal embeddings and the sentence classification tasks
   * Explanation of the pipeline for preprocessing the sentence and document classification datasets
   * Details about administrative issues
   * Expected for next week: literature review on data augmentation for NLP, literature review on GANs (state-of-the-art)
