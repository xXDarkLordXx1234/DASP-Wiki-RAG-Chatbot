---+!! Bachelors Thesis: Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs for Generative Question Answering

*Supervisor: Leonardo Ribeiro*

---++++ Week 25.08 - 31.08.2021

* Completed setting up Slurm, Wiki, including environments
* Computed perplexity
* Metrics in ELI5:
   * F1 for ROUGE-{1,2,L}
   * Human Judges
   * ROUGE-20%
   * FILL-1

---++++ Week 01.09 - 07.09.2021

* Ran baselines 
   * This time with full dataset because of access to cluster
   * Models: t5-base & bart-base
   * Datasets: ELI5 & GOOAQ 
      * (ELI5 transformed to pairs of questions and answers instead of 1:N relation)
   * Completed:
      * t5-base on gooaq

---++++ Week 08.09 - 14.09.2021

* Background research
   * Look into SOTA on ELI5
   * Look into using GNNs for QA
   * Evaulate potential approaches for improving QA using GNNs
   * Summarize in presentation for Leonardo
* Run QA-GNN as a baseline (and proof of working on ukp slurm cluster)
   * Had issues with running due to old gcc version
      * Fixed by installing gcc over conda (important: first install gcc, then install pytorch-geometric etc. as otherwise geometric uses the wrong path)

---++++ Week 15.09 - 21.09.2021

* Fix Baselines
   * Baselines use incorrect model parameters making them inferior to expected scores
   * Reformulate background research (tabular data etc.)
   * Perform entity extraction similar to QA-GNN
   * Perform subgraph extraction similar to QA-GNN
      * After that, think about extending subgraphs as they probably will not be large enough to contain the answer
      
---++++ Week 22.09 - 28.09.2021

* Add selftext to input
   * Does not improve performance
* Compare Conceptnet and DBPedia for ELI5
   * Conceptnet seems more adequate as knowledge is more general which ELI5 is likely to need more
   * Questions that are part of ELI5 are usually understood by the average person 
   * Conceptnet is more refined
* Subgraph extraction
   * Performance issues due to some computations only required in QAGNN

---++++ Week 29.09 - 05.10.2021

* Improve space efficiency of training scripts
* Switch from DBPedia as main KG to Conceptnet
* Run subgraph extraction 
   * Slow due to still present performance issues
   * Adjustment needed as QA-GNN often relies on the existance of answer candidates to build relevant hops
   * Script is often preempted
* While subgraph extraction is running, work on adding the main ELI5 baseline using fairseq
* Write thesis itself

---++++ Week 05.11 - 12.10.2021

* Complete subgraph extraction
* Complete graph linearization 
* Run experiment with graph linearization on extracted subgraphs but on reduced dataset size (1/20th)
   * Results slightly worse than previously. Perplexity much worse than previously
