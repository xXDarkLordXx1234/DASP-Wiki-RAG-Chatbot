   * <strike>How do I get Apache-Maven work? mvn install just throws BuildErrors: "Cannot execute mojo: clean. It requires a project with an existing pom.xml, but the build is not using one."
      * http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVENUSER/FAQs-1</strike>
   * <strike>Better work with Maven? Further dependencies would be solved better? (e.g. Lucene)
      * HowTo? Eclipse Plugin? Introduction?</strike>
         * *BH* Which eclipse plugin?
         * *BH* You could use Maven, but for the time being, you should stick to plain Java/Eclipse projects. I will give you further information on next weekly meeting.
   * PDF parsing is too slow for large docs - how to improve it?
      * *BH* Creation of an Index is more or less a one time process, therefore it is ok if it takes a little longer

   * How to find out, what a "createPrimitiveDescription", e.g. LuceneIndexWriter or AnnotationWriter, expects as parameters?
   * LuceneWriter is working with an old version of Lucene
   * java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.util.CasUtils.getSingleRequired(Lorg/apache/uima/jcas/JCas;Ljava/lang/Class;)Lorg/apache/uima/cas/FeatureStructure;

While indexing with Terrier test "testsector_terrier_indexing_108()" throws an error - but same folder with lucene works:

26.04.2010 22:37:51 main.java.de.tudarmstadt.ukp.manuelwick.dkpro.pipeline.PipelineFactory logTime(224)
INFO: Time needed for indexing documents: 11:46:123


Just check out the project from SVN (if sth. is missing, tell me, but normally all used libs should be up to date)<br />
Then go into JUnit Test "testsector_terrier_indexing_108()" in test.java.de.tudarmstadt.ukp.manuelwick.dkpro.experiments.Experiments<br />
Change the properties as it is shown in the test. IMPORTANT: The problem occurs only indexing folder 108 from the CRM data with Terrier, the other folders work.<br />
Run the test. Error should be thrown around 2670/11146 document.
