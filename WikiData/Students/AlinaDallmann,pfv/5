---+!! Master Thesis: Employing Graph Neural Networks for Text Production from Knowledge Graphs

*Start date*: 

*End date*:

*Supervisor*: Leonardo Ribeiro

*Midterm Talk*: 

*Final Talk*: 

---+++ Meeting 29.11.2019
---++++Last steps
   * Evaluation script using MoverScore, Multi-BLEU and Meteor
   * Trying to run models with batch size 20
   * Input method using features 
---++++Questions
   * Training with batch size 20 always leads to an out-of-memory error --> even when trying to block 64G memory
      * How to solve this issue?
   * Validation also using MoverScore --> takes quite long (~5 min) to calculate)?

---+++ Meeting 22.11.2019
---++++Last steps 
   * Getting scripts run with Slurm 
   * Train on AGENDA dataset with different preprocessing methods and gin/ggnn models 
   * Train on Visual Genome dataset  
   * Start writing theoretical chapters about datasets/ GNNs 

---++++Questions/ Next Steps 
   * Discuss on how to further structure the next steps. 
      * Trying different GNNs on all ways of preprocessing? 
         * Also take older NNs (from Pytorch-Geometric)? 
      * Or determine a good preprocessing way first? 
         * Understanding of creating a vector-based input still difficult 
   * AGENDA dataset 
      * Approach to use the node classes as well? --> e.g. put them as nodes in the graph as well? 
   * How to avoid CUDA out-of-memory error?  
      * How to determine the best amount of storage to reserve for training? 
   * How to determine the initial parameters intelligently? 
   * Official registration of thesis --> forward form to IG!?

---+++ Meeting 29.10.2019
---++++ Next Steps
   * Get model running on Slurm using AGENDA dataset
   * Try different dataset input options (LSTM, various linearisation methods)
   * Start writing theoretical chapters
