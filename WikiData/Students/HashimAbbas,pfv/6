   Try to find benefits and drawbacks for the following scenarios:
   * Pulling the data(information) from the database and sending it to another machine/server
   * Server pulls the data by itself and sends the data(information) in the message arguments to another machine/server

Following is the update: 

what you are currently working on,
   * Understand more spring 5 reactive system e.g Mono and Flux
   * Understand how reactive systems can help in our recommendation service
how far you have gotten,
   * I have now some understanding of what Mono and Flux are and how to implement them using router functions introduced in spring 5.  
how you are implementing it,
   * I implemented a sample example with Mono and Flux and also saw router functions as well which are introduced in spring 5 framework. 
what you plan on working on next,
   * I am currently trying to understand how a monolithical web application could be broken down in event based microservervice. 
what issues have come up,
   * Trying to figure out a scenario that how we can implement event based structure in our recommendation service. 
what you did to get around them,
   * Learn more about spring 5 framework, event based microservices. 
what is blocking you if you are stuck.

Following is the update on my status:

* what you are currently working on,*
I was currently researching:
   1 How to break our service in an efficient way so we can make it a micro-service
   2 Finding the best reactive framework for our application
   2 Now I will try to build a test akka actor model using akka documentation

* how far you have gotten,*

As we discussed in our last meeting I had to go through different reactive frameworks for our application, I found below article which has a really nice explanation and comparison for different reactive frameworks.

https://spring.io/blog/2016/06/07/notes-on-reactive-programming-part-i-the-reactive-landscape 

I read about some of the reactive frameworks which we can implement. Following are some useful links which I read and wanted to share them with you. 

1 Implementing Microservices using Java:

I read this book. The book is nice and basically builds up an architecture how we want to build our application but in the end it is based on Lagom framework which they said is open source but the main services we have to buy from them. So it is no use for us.

https://www.lightbend.com/blog/developing-reactive-microservices-free-oreilly-mini-book-by-java-champion-markus-eisele  

2 Microservice architecture pattern:

Its a small useful article about the microservice architecture pattern which tell how a microservice should be designed.  

http://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html

3 Building Reactive Systems Using Akkas Actor Model and Domain-Driven Design:

Really nice article that explains how akka actor models fulfils 4 main principles of reactive programming 

https://www.infoq.com/articles/Reactive-Systems-Akka-Actors-DomainDrivenDesign?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=java 

4 Building Reactive Applications with Akka Actors and Java 8

Another nice article which explains the use of akka actor model with reactive programming

* how you are implementing it,*

I think with the above what I have read, I should try to implement a simple test akka actor model and play with it. 

* what you plan on working on next,*

Implementing a test akka model. 

https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/java/actors.html#become-unbecome

* what issues have come up,*

Issues that I came up in many articles were that, some of them were using tools which were not open source

* what you did to get around them,*
--
* what is blocking you if you are stuck.*

I will let you know when I test run the test akka actor model. 

*My question:* 
Do you think I should try to run a test akka actor model now?
