---++++ *16.NOV.2017 - 22.NOV.2017*

 *Status of Last Week:*

   *what you are currently working on*
   * I am reading the W3C Web Annotation Working group recommendation.

      
   *how far you have gotten*
   *    I am trying to find the answers to the questions we discussed at the last meeting. For that, I read few papers but, they were not so much of help. Then I decided to go through the PDF specification itself. The papers I read are 
   
      Tagged Mathematics in PDFs for Accessibility and other purposes - Ross Moore

      A Benchmark and Evaluation for Text Extraction from PDF - Hannah Bast; Claudius Korzen

      A metadata and annotation extractor from PDF document for semantic web - Archana Shukla
	
      ARCTIC-metadata extraction from scientific papers in pdf using two-layer CRF - 	Alan Souza
 
   *   Just for a change I spend some time in learning CoffeeScript as well. 
   *   I read a significant part of pdf specification.  
   
   *how you are implementing it*
   *    As per my current understanding, I won't be going with CoffeeScript as debugging is not efficient with it.

   *what you plan on working on next*
   *    I am still not able to make a complete picture of what I have to deal with in terms of pdf text location. I need to fix this anyhow in the coming week. Also, need to think about if it is possible to save the location of the text in the pdf with for each text in the CAS. We somehow need to develop a relationship with the data in the CAS and PDF Text.  

   *what issues have come up*
   *    The existing js is not working somehow after my code changes.
   
   *what you did to get around them*
   *    Nothing yet, identified it some time back only

   *what is blocking you if you are stuck*
   *    Nothing which is kind of blocking

   * <del>Get the code up and running by fixing database related issues.</del> *Status:* Complete.
   * <del>Research on the context based methods to anchor annotations, described by W3C Web Annotation Working group.</del>*Status:* On it.
   * Work on the implementation part and get to see some actions. *Status:* Not Done.
   * Report: Start the background chapter *Status:* Not yet Started.
   * think about problems, solutions and the approach to find solution with a comparison between different solutions for the data management between the text-based and pdf based approach *Status:* Reading PDF                         specifications
