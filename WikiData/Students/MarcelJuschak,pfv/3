   * look at websites with German medical terms that Marcel found
   * discuss draft task description
   * idea: also use word embeddings to extend medical word lists
   * note: Marcel wants to hand in before start of October --> hard work required since this is one month less than usual for a Bachelor thesis
   * plan dates for mid-term presentation (10.7.) and final presentation (18.9.)

   * discuss related papers 
   * TODO(!ClS): draft task description

   * agreed on aim of thesis: automatically detect medical diagnosis (e.g. disease), medical test, and test results in texts --> unsupervised, there will only be a few documents for testing
   * talked about general expectations for thesis at UKP
   * discussed various possible dictionaries: UMLS, Wikipedia
   * either use various dictioniaries and dict extraction methdos and compare their usefulness
   * or go in the ML direction, i.e. train a classifier (on Medical word embeddings??) to also predict unknown medical words
   * Marcel will contribute to writing task description
      * TODO(!ClS): Send some examples of task description
   * programming language dependent on task
   * next steps: decide which direction to take, check possible dictionaries and data sources, draft task description
