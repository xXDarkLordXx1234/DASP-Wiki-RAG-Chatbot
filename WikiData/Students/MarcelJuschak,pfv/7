---++++ pre-meeting notes
   * extracted medical words from articles in wikipedia's category lists [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Krankheit][Krankheit]] and [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Krankheitssymptom][Krankheitssymptom]]
   * First attempt of finding medical terms in essays by matching them with occurrences in the created medical term lists (stopwords removed)
---++++ meeting notes
   * Pschyrembel is a very useful website but explicitly vorbids extraction of information: TODO Claudia: send email to ask about this
   * look at results of first extraction: problem that some non-medical terms are found, e.g. "seit" since current algorithm doesn't do exact match but checks if word m-grams are contained in a medical term (which may be made of various words)
   * next steps: (1) try stemming/lemmatizing, exact match, and approximate match (match except for 1 or 2 characters - can this solve spelling mistakes?!), (2) start to find large (freely available and useable) amounts of German medical text for training embeddings

---++++ pre-meeting notes
   * extracted first word list from website netDoktor.de using Python library Scrapy

---++++ meeting notes
   * discussed what should be mentioned as related work in thesis: 5 (to 10) papers with large overlap in goal, task, methods
   * next steps: identify more medical terms using Wikipedia pages of terms currently in the list

---++++ meeting notes
   * look at websites with German medical terms that Marcel found
   * discuss draft task description
   * idea: also use word embeddings to extend medical word lists
   * note: Marcel wants to hand in before start of October --> hard work required since this is one month less than usual for a Bachelor thesis
   * plan dates for mid-term presentation (10.7.) and final presentation (18.9.) 
   * TODO(!ClS): finalise Task Description
   * TODO(Marcel): start with creation of medical term lists


---++ 2018-04-19
---++++ meeting notes
   * discuss related papers 
   * TODO(!ClS): draft task description

---++ 2018-04-11
---++++ meeting notes
   * agreed on aim of thesis: automatically detect medical diagnosis (e.g. disease), medical test, and test results in texts --> unsupervised, there will only be a few documents for testing
   * talked about general expectations for thesis at UKP
   * discussed various possible dictionaries: UMLS, Wikipedia
   * either use various dictioniaries and dict extraction methdos and compare their usefulness
   * or go in the ML direction, i.e. train a classifier (on Medical word embeddings??) to also predict unknown medical words
   * Marcel will contribute to writing task description
      * TODO(!ClS): Send some examples of task description
   * programming language dependent on task
   * next steps: decide which direction to take, check possible dictionaries and data sources, draft task description
