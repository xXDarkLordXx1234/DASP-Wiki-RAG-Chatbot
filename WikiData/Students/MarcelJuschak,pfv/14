   * flexikon states that crawling is forbidden
   * focus on comparison of existing German word embeddings
   * add all websites found
   * Claudia to ask ULB about medical texts and UMLS
   * Domains that are currently planned to be crawled: [[https://www.netdoktor.de/][netdoktor.de]], [[https://www.apotheken-umschau.de/][apotheken-umschau.de]], [[https://www.dr-gumpert.de/][dr-gumpert.de]], [[https://www.gesundheit.de/][gesundheit.de]],[[https://www.medizin-lexikon.de/Hauptseite][ medizin-lexikon.de]]

---++++ pre-meeting notes
   * some more literature reviews
   * collected text from http://flexikon.doccheck.com

   * implemented Stringmatcher module, that compares phrases in the essay with terms in wordlists by 1. exact matching, 2. similarity, 3. exact matching with stemming. The class then outputs a version of the essay with annotations
   * Started indepth literature review for NER with Wikipedia and the Web
   * Question: What is meant with the work package P3 in the task description? Should out-of-vocabulary words manually be detected to create embeddings for them?
   * Question: FraMed is an ideal corpus focusing on clinical reports in order to advance information extraction, but the corpus is confidential and access protected. I guess Scientists are generally not allowed to grant access to such corporas to other scientists? (see the [[https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fcd7/067715040df59c8c4bc76e0695f1d5d4f460.pdf?_ga=2.268209550.1206075924.1526905647-1544907588.1526905647][Paper]])
   * Current thoughts on next steps: 1. create a corpus with text sorts similar to that of medical essays (should the provided essays be part of the corpus?), 2. learn embeddings with fasttext, 3. try finding out-of-vocabulary words by comparing word embeddings (now stringmatching based on semantic instead of lexical similarity), 4. Further approaches like finding medical terms in english in the more structured wikidata.org, but using inter language links to get the german articles (and words) out of it (may be a better approach to extract medical terms, but it is questionable whether a lot of NEW terms would come out of this). Another approach would be to learn to classify words in Wikipedia articles correctly and extract more medical terms this way. This would probably yield a lot more new terms that would otherwise be missed, but is also very prone to noise

   * extracted medical words from articles in wikipedia's category lists [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Krankheit][Krankheit]] and [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorie:Krankheitssymptom][Krankheitssymptom]]
   * First attempt of finding medical terms in essays by matching them with occurrences in the created medical term lists (stopwords removed)
   * TODO(Marcel): Stringmatching with 1. stemming and 2. similarity of 90% and 3. exact matching
---++++ meeting notes
   * Pschyrembel is a very useful website but explicitly vorbids extraction of information: TODO Claudia: send email to ask about this
   * look at results of first extraction: problem that some non-medical terms are found, e.g. "seit" since current algorithm doesn't do exact match but checks if word m-grams are contained in a medical term (which may be made of various words)
   * next steps: (1) try stemming/lemmatizing, exact match, and approximate match (match except for 1 or 2 characters - can this solve spelling mistakes?!), (2) start to find large (freely available and useable) amounts of German medical text for training embeddings

---++++ pre-meeting notes
   * extracted first word list from website netDoktor.de using Python library Scrapy

---++++ meeting notes
   * discussed what should be mentioned as related work in thesis: 5 (to 10) papers with large overlap in goal, task, methods
   * next steps: identify more medical terms using Wikipedia pages of terms currently in the list

---++ 2018-04-24
---++++ meeting notes
   * look at websites with German medical terms that Marcel found
   * discuss draft task description
   * idea: also use word embeddings to extend medical word lists
   * note: Marcel wants to hand in before start of October --> hard work required since this is one month less than usual for a Bachelor thesis
   * plan dates for mid-term presentation (10.7.) and final presentation (18.9.) 
   * TODO(!ClS): finalise Task Description
   * TODO(Marcel): start with creation of medical term lists


---++ 2018-04-19
---++++ meeting notes
   * discuss related papers 
   * TODO(!ClS): draft task description

---++ 2018-04-11
---++++ meeting notes
   * agreed on aim of thesis: automatically detect medical diagnosis (e.g. disease), medical test, and test results in texts --> unsupervised, there will only be a few documents for testing
   * talked about general expectations for thesis at UKP
   * discussed various possible dictionaries: UMLS, Wikipedia
   * either use various dictioniaries and dict extraction methdos and compare their usefulness
   * or go in the ML direction, i.e. train a classifier (on Medical word embeddings??) to also predict unknown medical words
   * Marcel will contribute to writing task description
      * TODO(!ClS): Send some examples of task description
   * programming language dependent on task
   * next steps: decide which direction to take, check possible dictionaries and data sources, draft task description
