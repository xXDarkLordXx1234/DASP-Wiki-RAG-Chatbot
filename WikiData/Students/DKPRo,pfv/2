---++ Ramblings about DKPRo
   * UkpTokenizer
      * Has an option to split at apostrophe, which is then included in second token - this is *counter-intuitive* IMHO
      * What about a UkpTokenization using Regexp?
   * In General
      * Many components are tailored to very specific annotations
         * e.g. the StemSnowballAnnotator only Stems Token Annotations
         * This should be somehow generalized that everything can be stemmed.
