   * went over language models & papers in detail and selected for fine-tuning and comparison
      1. T5
      2. BART
      3. CTRL
   * agreed on collaboration with Kevin for paper, due by June 1st, 2020
   * set up code environment for fine-tuning T5, with other models to follow. Currently, execution works successfully with _t5-small_ on the MONEY IS A SUBSTANCE metaphor
   * presentation next week (April 1, 2021) at 11am, 10mins talk + 10mins discussion

   * began researching language models for fine-tuning. Current candidates
      * T5
      * BART
      * CTRL
      * PPLM
      * GPT-2
   * wrote chapter on conceptual metaphor theory

   * implemented fitterBERT, resulting in a roughly 1000x speedup in creating sentence mappings
   * adopted Delemmatizer from fitBert
   * created figures for sentence and vocab distribution
   * computation of ALL possible sentence mappings running
   * *Mid-term presentation* on April 1, 2021
