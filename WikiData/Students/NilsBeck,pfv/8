---++ KW 15: April 12-18
   * successfully fine-tuned T5-base for _controlled_ metaphor generation
   * began researching and defining evaluation 
   * launched fine-tuning attempt for _free_ metaphor generation

---

---++ KW 14: April 5-11, 2021
   * launched first T5 fine-tuning attempt
   * recreational pause :)

---

---++ KW 13: March 29-April 4, 2021
   * held midterm presentation & received feedback
      * stick to T5, performs better than BART and others
      * consider multilingual models, such as mT5. Maybe evene better
      * consider multilingual training data, e.g., by linking FrameNet to GermaNet, Salsa, etc. as a *cross-lingual projection*
      * hyperparameter not a huge concern, since we use large data set

---

---++ KW 12: March 22-28, 2021
   * went over language models & papers in detail and selected for fine-tuning and comparison
      1. T5
      2. BART
      3. CTRL
   * agreed on collaboration with Kevin for paper, due by June 1st, 2020
   * set up code environment for fine-tuning T5, with other models to follow. Currently, execution works successfully with _t5-small_ on the MONEY IS A SUBSTANCE metaphor
   * presentation next week (April 1, 2021) at 11am, 10mins talk + 10mins discussion

---

---++ KW 11: March 15-21, 2021
   * created exhaustive set of sentence mappings from MetaNet and FrameNet, roughly 360.000 in total
   * began researching language models for fine-tuning. Current candidates
      * T5
      * BART
      * CTRL
      * PPLM
      * GPT-2
   * wrote chapter on conceptual metaphor theory
   * received draft paper from Kevin, where some of my work is planned to be included

---

---++ KW 10: March 8-14, 2021
   * implemented fitterBERT, resulting in a roughly 1000x speedup in creating sentence mappings
   * adopted Delemmatizer from fitBert
   * created figures for sentence and vocab distribution
   * computation of ALL possible sentence mappings running
   * *Mid-term presentation* on April 1, 2021

---

---++ KW 9: March 1-7, 2021
   * began writing introduction 
   * FitBERT way too slow -> began custom implementation building on huggingface's BERT
   * read related papers (anonymous submissions)
