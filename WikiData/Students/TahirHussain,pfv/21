---++++ Meeting Agenda
   * Scalable Workflows

---++ 14 June 2016


---++++ Deliverables
   * visualisation support in Galaxy (working on it).
   * galaxy with Spark (moved to post presentation). 

<hr>

---++ 31 May 2016
---++++ Meeting Agenda
   * Please provide DKPro Core code examples (to test them as workflow)
   * Are tagsets relevant to me?
      * REC: No. You should touch on the topic if formats in your report: the format is always XMI in our case, but not any order of components makes sense (even if we ignore tagsets and just consider inputs/outputs). E.g. component A outputs X and Y, it connects to component B which has as input X, B then connects to C which has as input Y. This would be in the pipeline. All inputs are fulfilled. But if we connect B to D and D requires Z as input, that would not work. Do you see any way to help the user here?
   * Once Spark implementation is complete, how would I test it? Would I be provided Spark cluster or something?
      * REC: please write mail to system-admin@ukp as discussed 
   * Scaling Strategy (HDFS)
   * As part of evaluation, what factors should I measure for galaxy and spark workflows.
   * Could it be the case than two or more readers or components be merged in a writer at once?
      * REC: In principle yes, but if we implement the pipeline execution as we had discussed it, this may be slightly difficult to handle. If you see a solution: good. If not, please discuss it in your report and try pointing out solutions. 
   * What are available languages for Readers and Writers? 
      * REC: language usually set as a parameter on readers, writers do usually not care 
   * Mid presentation date, 21st June.

   * Working implementation of DK Pro Core Workflow in galaxy.
   * possibly with Spark (need more time).

---++ 31st March 2016
---++++ Meeting Agenda
   * Thesis Registration
   * Following questions needs to be discussed related to DKPro Core
      1 Why Resource and Component are distributed separately in maven repository. Relationship between components and resources.
      2 Classification of components, can one be substituted for another.
      3 For workflow should I assume certain predefined components or it should be generic. How components can be listed.
      4 Order in a certain workflow is always sequential or it can be customised i.e branches etc.
      5 Scope of UIMA in workflow editor, i.e workflow will be generalised to UIMA pipeline or DK Pro Core Components.
      6 In Some of the example, some parts of UIMA pipeline were provided by user, i.e final Writer component. Does it mean user can import custom components in workflow.
      7 Workflow should be defined as UIMA compatible xml format, or some other way
   * Some references from today
      * Groovy-based scripts with DKPro Core - https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-core/groovy/recipes/
      * DKPro Script - still simpler scripting for DKPro Core - https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-script/
      * Auto-generated DKPro Core documentation: https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-core/tree/master/dkpro-core-doc
