---++++ Meeting Agenda
   * Thesis Registration
   * Following questions needs to be discussed related to DKPro Core
      1 Relationship between components and related resources in DK Pro Core. Can resources location be inferred from component?
      2 Why these are distributed separately in maven repository.
      3 Classification of components, can one be substituted for another.
      4 In a Workflow how and from where the components will be listed.
      5 For workflow should I assume certain predefined components or it should be generic.
      6 Order in a certain workflow is always sequential or it can be customised i.e branches etc.
      7 Scope of UIMA in workflow editor, i.e workflow will be generalised to UIMA pipeline or DK Pro Core Components.
      8 In Some of the example, some parts of UIMA pipeline were provided by user, i.e final Writer component. Does it mean user can import custom components in workflow.
      9 Workflow should be defined as UIMA compatible xml format, or some other way
