---++ 31st March 2016
---++++ Meeting Agenda
   * Thesis Registration
   * Following questions needs to be discussed related to DKPro Core
      1 Why Resource and Component are distributed separately in maven repository. Relationship between components and resources.
      2 Classification of components, can one be substituted for another.
      3 For workflow should I assume certain predefined components or it should be generic. How components can be listed.
      4 Order in a certain workflow is always sequential or it can be customised i.e branches etc.
      5 Scope of UIMA in workflow editor, i.e workflow will be generalised to UIMA pipeline or DK Pro Core Components.
      6 In Some of the example, some parts of UIMA pipeline were provided by user, i.e final Writer component. Does it mean user can import custom components in workflow.
      7 Workflow should be defined as UIMA compatible xml format, or some other way
