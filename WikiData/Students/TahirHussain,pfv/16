---++ 31 May 2016
---++++ Meeting Agenda
   * Please provide DKPro Core code examples (to test them as workflow)
   * Are tags relevant to me?
   * Starting points for generating tool descriptions
   * Once I Spark implementation is complete, how would I test it? Would I be provided Spark cluster or something?
   * Scaling Strategy (HDFS)
   * As part of evaluation, what factors should I measure for galaxy and spark workflows.
   * Could it be the case than two or more readers or components be merged in a writer at once?
   * What are available languages for Readers and Writers? 

---++++ Deliverables
   * Working implementation of DK Pro Core Workflow in galaxy and [possibly in Spark (pending)].

---++ 31st March 2016
---++++ Meeting Agenda
   * Thesis Registration
   * Following questions needs to be discussed related to DKPro Core
      1 Why Resource and Component are distributed separately in maven repository. Relationship between components and resources.
      2 Classification of components, can one be substituted for another.
      3 For workflow should I assume certain predefined components or it should be generic. How components can be listed.
      4 Order in a certain workflow is always sequential or it can be customised i.e branches etc.
      5 Scope of UIMA in workflow editor, i.e workflow will be generalised to UIMA pipeline or DK Pro Core Components.
      6 In Some of the example, some parts of UIMA pipeline were provided by user, i.e final Writer component. Does it mean user can import custom components in workflow.
      7 Workflow should be defined as UIMA compatible xml format, or some other way
   * Some references from today
      * Groovy-based scripts with DKPro Core - https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-core/groovy/recipes/
      * DKPro Script - still simpler scripting for DKPro Core - https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-script/
      * Auto-generated DKPro Core documentation: https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-core/tree/master/dkpro-core-doc
