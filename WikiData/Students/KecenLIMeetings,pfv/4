---++ Meeting 31.7.2017

Objectives achieved last week: 

   * PDF and XML conversion code
   * tested deeplearning4j on 10 papers relating IQA (image quality assessment)
   * installed solr
   * elsevier classification seems not plausible

Planned tasks:
   * ask elsevier dev team for category search
   * classification filtering in springer and elsevier
   * read suggested papers on word embeddings and query expansion
   * implement word2vec in kbrs and explore more functionality and configs
   * fix reader webapp dependencies

General idea:
   * aggregation approach (based on publication date or randomness) - time does carry extra informations which is important.
   * evaluation on the above mentioned publication date approach (will new words be added into vector space during aggregated learning? even added, any different outcome)
   * batch vs aggregation (take both into account, maybe a trade-off like a hybrid model for the system)
   * actual evaluation approach, a bench mark together with deeplearning4j similarity comparison



---++ Meeting 24.7.2017

Planned tasks:
   * PDF conversion
   * deeplearning4j test on 10-20 papers
   * Solr (index schema file + mysql schema from Masoud)
   * complete xml processing with uima


---++ Meeting 17.7.2017

Objectives achieved: 

   * briefing on VM and APU at UKP server
   * summary of current status of resourceSync harvester
   * introduction of Solr into the project
   * discussion on presentation schedule

Planned tasks:
   * obtain category list from Springer/Elsevier
   * implement Springer/Elsevier paper category filtering
   * implement XML conversion into formatted text file (schema discovery)
   * implement PDF conversion into formatted text file for Springer
   * experiment obtained text files with embedding learner in deeplearning4j framework
   * setup VM environment at UKP server (kbrs.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de)
   * No. of files estimation for disk space required
