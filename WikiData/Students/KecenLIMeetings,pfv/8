---++ Meeting 29.8.2017

Planned Tasks:

   * try to complete the springer paper training and test on elsevier datasets

Discussion:

   * for the time being, it's fine with doing filtering only one time.
   * using deeplearning4j to classify computer science related springer and elsevier papers (para2vec with classifier)
      * Other option: using SciKit-Learn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/document_classification_20newsgroups.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-text-document-classification-20newsgroups-py

Ideas noted:
   
   * incremental training evaluation done offline with papers batches separated by dates, online incremental training might not be feasible if we don't continuously feed new paper into the system
   

---++ Meeting 21.8.2017

Planned Tasks:

   * search result reranking mechanism 
   * ** document against user library divergence
   * ** document vector comparison
   * check document vector in deeplearning4j

Ideas noted:
  
   * user library document divergence: low such that the library can be used to rerank search result, high means user is just doing explortory search

---++ Meeting 31.7.2017

Planned Tasks:

   * filtering papers on APU for both Springer and Elsevier
   * word2vec aggregation training implementation in kbrs
   * finish relevant reading


---++ Meeting 31.7.2017

Objectives achieved last week: 

   * PDF and XML conversion code
   * tested deeplearning4j on 10 papers relating IQA (image quality assessment)
   * installed solr
   * elsevier classification seems not plausible

Planned tasks:
   * ask elsevier dev team for category search
   * classification filtering in springer and elsevier
   * read suggested papers on word embeddings and query expansion
   * implement word2vec in kbrs and explore more functionality and configs
   * fix reader webapp dependencies

General idea:
   * aggregation approach (based on publication date or randomness) - time does carry extra informations which is important.
   * evaluation on the above mentioned publication date approach (will new words be added into vector space during aggregated learning? even added, any different outcome)
   * batch vs aggregation (take both into account, maybe a trade-off like a hybrid model for the system)
   * actual evaluation approach, a bench mark together with deeplearning4j similarity comparison



---++ Meeting 24.7.2017

Planned tasks:
   * PDF conversion
   * deeplearning4j test on 10-20 papers
   * Solr (index schema file + mysql schema from Masoud)
   * complete xml processing with uima


---++ Meeting 17.7.2017

Objectives achieved: 

   * briefing on VM and APU at UKP server
   * summary of current status of resourceSync harvester
   * introduction of Solr into the project
   * discussion on presentation schedule

Planned tasks:
   * obtain category list from Springer/Elsevier
   * implement Springer/Elsevier paper category filtering
   * implement XML conversion into formatted text file (schema discovery)
   * implement PDF conversion into formatted text file for Springer
   * experiment obtained text files with embedding learner in deeplearning4j framework
   * setup VM environment at UKP server (kbrs.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de)
   * No. of files estimation for disk space required
