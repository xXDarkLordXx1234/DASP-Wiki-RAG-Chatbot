---++ Meetings

---+++ Next meeting


---+++ 2015-06-11
   * Training data
      * Use Freebase - Wikidata identifiers mapping either on a subset of ClueWeb or on Free917 (only for debugging purposes)
         * Google provides mapping of Freebase ids to WikiData (it is old, from 2013)
         * todo(RB) try to extract mappings from WikiData (use Property "Freebase identifier"). How many of them is there? Overlap with the Google mapping?
      * Wikipedia links as WikiData annotations
         * Look only at the titles and abstracts first
         * todo(RB) map Wikipedia links to WikiData item ids 
   * Reddy's code
      * Virtuoso is too large to run locally
      * todo(DS) ask about reserving a server or hosting a Virtuoso database

---+++ 2015-10-30
   * Status Update
      * Tried to obtain a subset of Freebase to actually test Reddy et.al results. But no small enough dataset was available.
      * Subsequently tried downloading whole of Freebase but have been unsucccessful due to system constraints and performance (under-going).
      * Read literature on deep learning and some NLP machine learning approaches.
   * todo(RB): *Enroll at the Prüfungssekretariat*
      * It is about time to do that. Figure out what do you need for that, there is some form that Prof. Gurevych has to sign.
      * Form submitted to IG 
   * todo(RB): description of packages (undergoing)
   * todo(RB): how to get a sample of Freebase to try out the grounded semantic parsing (*status update*)
      * Wait for Reddy's answer
   * todo(DS): a paper on other features that could be used
   * todiscuss: Could we e-mail Reddy to get access to the dataset and to replicate TACL results (as mentioned on his GitHub profile)
      * Yes


---+++ 2015-10-16
   * Pool access
   * Wiki Meeting Minutes (once the account is activated)
      * Use them for progress updates, small question, to collect literature
   * Latex template
   * SVN

---+++ 2015-10-09
   * Regular meetings
      * Friday at 12:00
   * Mid-term, final presentation
      * Mid-term:
      * Final: 01.03.15
   * Student presentations next week: 13.10.2015 at 11:30
   * Computational Semantics book
   * Update on Reddy's code
      * todo(RB): description of packages
   * WikiData: how to proceed with the scheme mapping
      * First trying to replicate results with Freebase, then transition to WikiData
   * Ungrounded semantic parsing is working out of the box
   * todo(RB) What is need to run the grounded parsing with Freebase? To replicate Reddy's result with provided models (without retraining)?

---+++ Summary of the initial meeting
   * Starting date: 15.09.2015, Deadline: 15.03.2015
   * Enroll at the Prüfungssekretariat: ~15.10.2015
