---++ Meetings

---+++ Next Meeting
   * Status Update
      * Tried to obtain a subset of Freebase to actually test Reddy et.al results. But no small enough dataset was available.
      * Subsequently tried downloading whole of Freebase but have been unsucccessful due to system constraints and performance (under-going).
      * Read literature on deep learning and some NLP machine learning approaches.
   * todo(RB): *Enroll at the Prüfungssekretariat*
      * It is about time to do that. Figure out what do you need for that, there is some form that Prof. Gurevych has to sign.
   * todo(RB): description of packages (undergoing)
   * todo(RB): how to get a sample of Freebase to try out the grounded semantic parsing (*status update*)
   * todo(DS): a paper on other features that could be used
   * todiscuss: Could we e-mail Reddy to get access to the dataset and to replicate TACL results (as mentioned on his GitHub profile)

      * First trying to replicate results with Freebase, then transition to WikiData
   * Ungrounded semantic parsing is working out of the box
   * todo(RB) What is need to run the grounded parsing with Freebase? To replicate Reddy's result with provided models (without retraining)?
