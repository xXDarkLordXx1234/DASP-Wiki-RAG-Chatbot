---++++ *Bachelor Thesis* : Deep Learning for Citation Count Prediction


*Start date* :  05.10.2017

*Supervisor*: Dr Steffen Eger



---++++ *Current Status*
   * 25.10.2017
      * Created Statistics for the datasets(see attached dataset.pdf). Problem: train/dev split is to small for the CL dataset prediction task. This is because most papers are in 2016 and 2017. The smallest time span for predictions is citations within one year because there is no information about the citation month. Therefore the train/dev split has to be, to avoid overlapping with test split, in 2014, which is small. 
      * Evaluation of models on abstract and full text(see attached experiments.pdf). So far only the yogatama baseline has some good results. I noticed some difference in my implementation to the one described in the paper. I will change it and hopefully improve it further. VDCNN not tested yet but I made my own implementation which should work. I am also trying to use an MLP instead to logistic Regression on the yogatama features.   
   * 18.10.2017
      * Began evaluating different models. So far no interesting results. Models need to be optimized.
         * SE: Better than baseline? Do you tokenize your data? On which level do you work: abstract, intro, conclusion, full text?
            * yogatama(with author and venue info) on tokenized abstract   works ok for modelling task. about 6.5% better accuracy than baseline . baseline level for prediction. 
            * yogatama on full text better(modelling task), almost 10% improvement over baseline.
            * simple cnn at baseline
            * fasttext slightly over baseline
            * vdcnn not running yet :(

   * 17.10.2017:
      * program to create dataset on apu /home/netzer/semanticScholarDBcomplete:
         * run.sh: runs every step to create the full dataset. category can be changed in script(see comments). I did not test how long a full run takes.
         * finished CL dataset: semanticScholar_csCL_FULL.jsonl . Every line is a paper + metdata encoded as json
         * sample paper : example.txt
      * all arxiv papers: /home/netzer/arxiv
   * 11.10.2017:
      * Datensatz mit papern aus  high-energy physics ist fertig.
      * Ich habe angefangen das Modell von Yogatama zu implementieren. Bisher habe ich nur Ridge Regression verwendet. Im paper wir diese mit einem  Generalized Linear Model mit Time Series Regularization verglichen. F체r letzteres gibt es keine fertigen Implementierungen. Ich bin mir nicht sicher wie viel Aufwand das w채re.
      * Sonst bin ich dabei ein Framework zu bauen, mit dem ich die Experimente mit verschieden Evaluierungsszenarios,Datens채tzen und Modellen strukturiert durchf체hren kann. 
   

---++ Meeting Minutes


---++++  *Meeting 19.10.2017*
   * Parameters to play around with:
      * Stop words on/off
      * Evaluate deep learning approaches on abstract, intro, conclusion, whole text
      * Can include/exclude author, venue, etc. both in Yogotama baseline and in Deep Learning approaches
         * You could do it as follows (or differently): "{Title}%%%{Author1,Author2,...}%%%{Abstract}%%%{Intro}%%%{Body}%%%{Conclusion}%%%{References}" as a long sequence of text.
      * Use ridge regression or alternatively MLP for Yogotama et al. baseline
   * TODOs:
      * fix/optimize the conclusion extractor
      * document "run.sh" a little better: what do the arguments stand for? where is the output written to?
      * make a statistics:
         * how many papers overall? how many in your train/dev/test splits?
---++++ *Meeting 12.10.2017*

   * Please provide SE with the following:
      * Sample full texts on apu (ideally already pre-processed) with meta data
      * Program to download meta data from SemanticScholar
      * All full texts stored on apu
   * Very important:
      * *Structure* and *document* your coding
         * Can document by placing everything in simple bash scripts, for example, that could always be re-run
   * When forecasting, you can play around with the forcecast gap, e.g., 1 year, 2 years, etc.
   * For n-gram vectors you can play around with their sizes (e.g. same number of 1-grams than 2-grams?)
   * TODOs for next week: evaluate Yogatama et al. baseline as well as deep learning models on apu (FastText, Very Deep Conv Nets, Standard Conv Nets)
