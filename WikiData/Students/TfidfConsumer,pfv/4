---++ TfidfConsumer and TfidfAnnotator

%TOC%

---+++ Summary
A TfidfConsumer processes all documents and counts the number of occurrences of each word (may be a special annotation as well).

   * tf stands for text frequency
   * idf stands for inverse document frequency
   * measure to calculate the importance of a term

---+++ Requirements
   * implements Serializable to store it in file on disk
   * has method for retrieving tf (number of times in documents divided by number of all words) (parameters: docID, word)
   * has method for retrieving idf (logarithm of number of documents divided by number of documents containing the word)  (parameters: word)
   * has method for retrieving tfidf (tf * idf) (parameters: docID, word)

---+++ Implementation of consumer
   * HashMap with word as key and number of documents containing word as value
   * HashMap with docId as key and another HashMap as value. The other HashMap has the word as key and the number of words in the document as value
   
---+++ Implementation of annotator
   * Methods for accessing store and retrieving tf, idf, and tfidf

---+++ Implementation of store
   *    HashMap<Pair of docId and Word, double> values for text frequency
   *    HashMap<Word,double> values for inverse document frequency
