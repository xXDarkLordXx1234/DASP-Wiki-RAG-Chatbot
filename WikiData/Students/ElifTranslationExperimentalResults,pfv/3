---+ Translation Experimental Results
---++ Goals
   * Creating resources for resource-poor languages (in our case, German) by translating subjectivity lexicons from other languages such as English
---++ Related Work
---++ Methods
---++ Results with Universal Dictionary
   * Translation with Universal Dictionary yields low results
      * Only ~500 words from !OpinionFinder were translated (out of ~8200 entries) by using the "full" UD dictionary
      * Only ~1000 words were translated by using both the "full" and the "light" UD dictionary
         * See ElifLexicalResources for further information

---++ Results with Wiktionary and Self-written Parser
   * Translation of !OpinionFinder lexicon with self-written parser for Wiktionary yields following results: 
      * Number of translated words 2052 out of 8221 total. Not translated: 6169
      * Of those not translated
         * 1273 because lack of Part-of-Speech
         * Many more because lack of Translations entries (see .ods document)
      * *Questions:*
         1 Do all the OpinionFinder entries exist in the English Wiktionary? you should look for the lemma form of the ones with stemmed=y.

---++ Results with Wiktionary and JWKTL
---++ Results with MOSES
   * Low quality results for some words
   * MOSES seems better suited for translating sentences, not single words
---++ Results with OPUS
   * http://urd.let.rug.nl/tiedeman/OPUS/
   * http://urd.let.rug.nl/tiedeman/OPUS/lex.php
   * Uses GIZA++ like MOSES, is better suited for single-word translations
   * Results when translating !OpinionFinder Lexicon: 
         * 4158 of 8221 words translated 
         * 4063 not translated
