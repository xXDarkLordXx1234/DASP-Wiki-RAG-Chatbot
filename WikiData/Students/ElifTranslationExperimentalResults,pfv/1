      * Only ~500 words from !OpinionFinder were translated (out of ~8200 entries) by using the "full" UD dictionary
      * Only ~1000 words were translated by using both the "full" and the "light" UD dictionary
         * See ElifLexicalResources for further information

---++ Results with Wiktionary and Self-written Parser
   * Translation of !OpinionFinder lexicon with self-written parser for Wiktionary yields following results: 
      * Number of translated words 2052 out of 8221 total. Not translated: 6169
      * Of those not translated
         * 1273 because lack of Part-of-Speech
         * Many more because lack of Translations entries (see .ods document)
      * *Questions:*
         1 Do all the OpinionFinder entries exist in the English Wiktionary? you should look for the lemma form of the ones with stemmed=y.
