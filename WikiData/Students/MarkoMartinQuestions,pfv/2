   * How to connect with Cisco VPN Client? Do I need "Group Authentication" data?
      * _29.06.2010_: Problem solved with generic Windows VPN connection
   * Wikipedia articles are divided both in paragraphs and sections - what would be the appropriate granularity for segmentation algorithms?
      * _29.06.2010_: The Wikipedia reader component should be able to mark regions as segments such as defined with a parameter (e.g., only for sections, for sections and sub sections, for paragraphs etc.); however, for sake of simplicity, flat (not hierarchical) segment annotations are sufficient. Other components do not have to distinguish between different kinds of segments.
