   * How can the original file name of a CAS that has been read by a FileSystemReader be obtained?
   * Does UIMA use the same AnalysisEngine instance for all processed CASes?
   * How should a consumer be implemented which "consumes all CASes"? E.g., for evaluation, a component would be desirable which writes evaluation results (as an average or a sum of all single per-document results) to a file.
   * Are these package names appropriate?
      * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.semantics.segmenter.consumer (for PlainTextWriter, AnnotationOffsetWriter, SegmentationEvaluator)
      * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.semantics.reader (for WikipediaCategoryReader)

   * How to connect with Cisco VPN Client? Do I need "Group Authentication" data?
      * _29.06.2010_: Problem solved with generic Windows VPN connection
   * Wikipedia articles are divided both in paragraphs and sections - what would be the appropriate granularity for segmentation algorithms?
      * _29.06.2010_: The Wikipedia reader component should be able to mark regions as segments such as defined with a parameter (e.g., only for sections, for sections and sub sections, for paragraphs etc.); however, for sake of simplicity, flat (not hierarchical) segment annotations are sufficient. Other components do not have to distinguish between different kinds of segments.
