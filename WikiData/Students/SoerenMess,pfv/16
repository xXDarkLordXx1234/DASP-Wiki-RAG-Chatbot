   * @discuss(CS): IAA per essay?
   * @discuss(CS): Subjectivity lexicon for feature engineering
      * http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/
   * @discuss(CS): statistics about plausible and non-plausible relations/premises.
   * @discuss(CS): The term _plausibility_ should be elaborated in more detail in the annotation guideline. Here are some ideas that might help:
      * For deciding if a premise is plausible, it might make sense to include some of the following notions in the annotation guidelines:
         * <u>Subjectivity</u>: Is it a subjective of objective statement? Does the statement deal with *perspectives*, *experiences*, *feelings*, *beliefs*, *desires*? Answer the question how to distinguish that! This is crucial for obtaining a good IAA.
         * <u>Verifiability</u>: Is it possible to check the *correctness* or the *truth* of the statement?
         * <u>Acceptability</u>: 
            * Take a look a Dalmer (2012) page 34. There are many properties which might help. Include them in the annotation guideline. (The term 'claim' in this section should be considered as assertion. It is not the same as our definition of the term!)
      * For deciding if a premise is relevant to the truth of the claim the following might help:
         * Is the claim and the premise about the same *topic*?
         * Is the premise *relevant* to the truth of the claim?
            * Compare definition of Dalmer: "A premise is relevant if its acceptance provides some reason to believe, counts in favor of, or has some bearing on the truth or merit of the conclusion. A premise is irrelevant if its acceptance has no bearing on, provides no evidence for, or has no connection to the truth or merit of the conclusion."
         * Is the premise really a *reason* which underpins the validity of the claim?
         * How to decide if the premise is a *reformulation* of the claim?
      * In principle: 
         * The annotation guideline should include a precise and clear definition of the two plausibility concepts (I know you have included a definition in bold face, but I feel it should be more detailed).
            * Define criteria which have to be fulfilled in both cases. In the examples, show which of the criteria (see above) is fulfilled and which are not. 
         * Maybe it might make sense to include <u>questions</u>, which the author can answer during the decision process. It might also make sense to include a decision tree for facilitating the annotation.
