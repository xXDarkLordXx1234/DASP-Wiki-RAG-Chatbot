%META:TOPICPARENT{name="StudentsList"}%
---++ Week _14.05.-23.05._:
   * created Language Model without context (show github)
   * refactored some of the code base
   * integrated the datasets into my repository
   
---+++++ Whats next? (this week)
   * run LM on krusty 
      * calculate perplexity + loss for each
   * start writing on thesis:
      * preprocessing of datasets
      * features of every datasets
    

---++ Week _07.05.-14.05._:
   * created overview on [[https://git.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/lind/style-variation-datasets][readme]]
   * implemented first version language model 

---+++++ Whats next?
   * need to refactor everything
   * run & test it on krusty
   * i have a seminar next week i need to work on urgently
---+++++ Future:
   * reread papers of datasets to add comments 
      * short description how it is used
      * short description on which model is used
  

---++ Week _30.04-07.05._:
   * compiled necessary datasets, uploaded to gitlab, made a nice structure to use in future that is modular
   * tried, read and failed to learn how a Language Model in the style setting should work
   1 All on datasets:
---++++ downloaded and processed following datasets:
   * rottentomatoes
   * shakespear by jhamtani
   * yelp_gender prabhumoye
   * yelp sentiment
---++++ on the dataset we were unsure of:
   * imdb review
my suggestion would be now:
   * dropoff for equal distribution of attributes (we have enough datapoints)

---++++ dataset im unsure to use:
   * stanford sentiment treebank
because it was used for a summarization task and they only got sentiment, but maybe still usable as the other datasets....

---++++ other datasets:
   * robvoigt (i will show you samples in my docs, lets discuss which may be usable)
 
   2 All on the Language Model implementation:

I think i have huge misunderstandings in Ficler & Goldberg, need to talk to you...
I've created an overview of all technical details used in the paper (i will show and try to explain).
Questions on:
   1 Embeddings
   2 Feature usage
   3 Role of LSTM
   4 n-grams and prediction

My plans for following week:

   * look what you say about the datasets
   * may work on this aswell (create a overview, create examples etc.)

   * Understand how the Language Model i try to implement should work (math and structure)
   * Read the newest papers you suggested on mendeley (from 16. april to 1.may ...)
   * inform goezde about my seminar
