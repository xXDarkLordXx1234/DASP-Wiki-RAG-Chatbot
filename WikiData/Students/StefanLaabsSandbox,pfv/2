Identifying and defining the use cases

Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible by Alan Kay

In the paper () are three groups of basic tasks already identified: Find, Edit and Organize

For a more detailed look, we will go stepwise through these different groups and look in detail, what the user is willing to do. Also the task find will be renamed to search.
