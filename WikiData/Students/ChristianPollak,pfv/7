---+ Meeting 2015-12-25
   A    Dagstuhl-playing of Argotario showed some bugs and lead to some ideas: 
   
   * no topics at some valid arguments, 
   * timeouts
   * argument-composing for same topic
   * database highschores did not update
   * get rid of webkit
   * suggest topics yourself
   * argument comparison to find best ones
   * spam auto-delete
   * maybe remove topic for stance-recognition
  
   B   Insert new fallacy-types into game:
     
   * Non-context
      * appeal to emotion,
      * irrelevant authority
      * hasty generalization
      * appeal to consequences
   * context:
      * ad hominem
      * red herring
 
   C   Develop ideas for PvP-Gamecontent
