---+!! Bachelor Thesis: Context-Aware Relation Extraction for Scientific Data
Mid-Term Presentation: 23.01.2018

End Presentation: 20.03.2018

---++ Next Meeting: 30.01.2018, 14:00 
   
---++ Meeting: 23.01.2018, after mid-term presentation
   * Reverse direction is given
   * Provides Test Data: 150 abstract per task
   * try up-sampling
   * evaluation script for shared task
   * another approach: use pre-trained model from wikidata to predict relations (map them...)

   ToDo:
   * change Reverse (marker, classes, ...) &#10004;
   * fit test data to model &#10004;
   * evaluation script &#10004;
   * try up-sampling &#10004;
   * test different models and params &#10004;
   
---++ Meeting: 16.01.2018
   * Namespace issues with "embeddings" after fork, temporary work-around fix in my repo

   * rework presentation -> send before presentation (friday, monday...)
   * search and find bug (why only predict 2 or 3 classes?) -> until friday morning
   * evaluation script for shared task
---++ Meeting: 08.01.2018
   * DS: It seems I don't have access to your fork of the relation-extraction repo. 

   * BiLSTM-Merge-Mode (Concat, Ave, Sum, Mul) -> Concat, change the shapes of the following layers &#10004;
   * Every model with LSTM or BiLSTM &#10004;
   * Max_Sentence_Length -> maybe take average or take a length which cover 80% of the text (evaluate this...)
   * Max_Edges_per-Grap -> take 11 (max, other value on noisy data set)
   * Do not combine clean and noisy data set &#10004;
   * Most deprecated methods had been updated to Keras API 2, just .Merge(Lambda...) is missing
   * Do not care about CNN theano/tensorflow "bug"
   * Validate Model after every Epoch (already done) &#10004;
   * Evaluation Phase of the shared task has changed (see CodaLab), now on 22.01 instead of 08.01
   * Change Dev and Test Set: Test on 100 (not 70), Dev on 50 (not 70) abstracts &#10004;
   * Krusty

ToDo's:
   * Give access to the fork (not guest...) &#10004;
   * add preprocessing script to model (need to clean it up a bit) &#10004;

   * Prepare mid-term presentation
   * 20min presentation, 10min questions
   * Motivation, Task, Related Work, Goals, Timeline/Outline, Data Analysis, Model
   * prepare this until next week
   
---++ Meeting: 18.12.2017
   
   * I need access to more computing power, my machine is overwhelmed -> try krusty
   * Tensorflow as Keras Backend can be used without any change
   * Unique IDs per Abstract may be useful
   * Order in edgeSet is important
   * Blacklist: filtered relations
   * Focus on abstractwise (abstractwise edge-sets)
   * Improvements: implement biLSTM
 
---++ Meeting: 07.12.2017, 15:00

   * Some Question about Word Embeddings solved
   * Held-out data -> may be important for me too, need to be checked
   * Relparser in parser.py is Relation Encoder
   * Attention is "Selective Attention" from Lin et al

Todos: 
   * Try the current model on local machine
   * Change Keras Backend from Theano to Tenserflow


---++ Meeting: 30.11.2017, 15:00

   * Attached Anmeldeformular, Datum der Themenvergabe? May need to be checked...
   * Changed Declaration: (just to keep in mind and may update the template) [[https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_Studbuero/Erklaerung_zur_Abschlussarbeit_Vorlage.pdf][New Declaration]]

Questions: 
   * include Approach of data analysis in text? -> no need to, too obvious
      *  include Code of the data analysis approach somewhere?  -> just store it for myself

   * Which strategy for REVERSE? --> separated classes or "pipelined"
   * try a machine learning approach (maybe at the end...)
   * start with a simple local model
   * familiarize with model &#10004;
   

   

---++ Meeting: 21.11.2017, 15:00

Questions: 
   * there may not be enough relations in single sentences -> "abstract-wise"
   * focus on words and sentences in data analysis (e.g. average Word Length not that useful)

Todos:
   * Examples of training data &#10004;
   * data analysis &#10004;
      * with graphs/plots and some bulletpoints &#10004;

   * setup repo for thesis &#10004;
   * fork project &#10004;
   * VPN &#10004;
   * Anmeldeformular &#10004;

Literature:
   * Augenstein et al (see Task Description...)
   * Eger et al (see Task Description...)
