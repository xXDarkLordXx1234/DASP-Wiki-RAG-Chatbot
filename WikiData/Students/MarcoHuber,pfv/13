---+!! Bachelor Thesis: Context-Aware Relation Extraction for Scientific Data
Mid-Term Presentation: 31.01.2018

End Presentation: 20.03.2018

---++ Next Meeting: 08.01.2018, 15:00 (maybe on 04.01/05.01)
   * DS: It seems I don't have access to your fork of the relation-extraction repo. 

---++ Meeting: 18.12.2017
   
   * I need access to more computing power, my machine is overwhelmed -> try krusty
   * Tensorflow as Keras Backend can be used without any change
   * Unique IDs per Abstract may be useful
   * Order in edgeSet is important
   * Blacklist: filtered relations
   * Focus on abstractwise (abstractwise edge-sets)
   * Improvements: implement biLSTM
 
---++ Meeting: 07.12.2017, 15:00

   * Some Question about Word Embeddings solved
   * Held-out data -> may be important for me too, need to be checked
   * Relparser in parser.py is Relation Encoder
   * Attention is "Selective Attention" from Lin et al

Todos: 
   * Try the current model on local machine
   * Change Keras Backend from Theano to Tenserflow


---++ Meeting: 30.11.2017, 15:00

   * Attached Anmeldeformular, Datum der Themenvergabe? May need to be checked...
   * Changed Declaration: (just to keep in mind and may update the template) [[https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_Studbuero/Erklaerung_zur_Abschlussarbeit_Vorlage.pdf][New Declaration]]

Questions: 
   * include Approach of data analysis in text? -> no need to, too obvious
      *  include Code of the data analysis approach somewhere?  -> just store it for myself

   * Which strategy for REVERSE? --> separated classes or "pipelined"
   * try a machine learning approach (maybe at the end...)
   * start with a simple local model
   * familiarize with model &#10004;
   

   

---++ Meeting: 21.11.2017, 15:00

Questions: 
   * there may not be enough relations in single sentences -> "abstract-wise"
   * focus on words and sentences in data analysis (e.g. average Word Length not that useful)

Todos:
   * Examples of training data &#10004;
   * data analysis &#10004;
      * with graphs/plots and some bulletpoints &#10004;

   * setup repo for thesis &#10004;
   * fork project &#10004;
   * VPN &#10004;
   * Anmeldeformular &#10004;

Literature:
   * Augenstein et al (see Task Description...)
   * Eger et al (see Task Description...)
