Anshul Tak's HIWI page is [[Hiwi.AnshulTak][here]]
---+++ Meeting 13.11.2016
   * Link updated [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/AnshulThesis-2016.pdf][thesis report]]
   * Link Mid term [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/Anshul_Thesis_Mid_Term_ppt.odp][ppt]]
   * Link [[%ATTACHURLPATH%/InitialEval.ods][Initial evaluation]] for constraints 
---+++ Meeting 07.11.2016
   * Perform evaluation to check if adding constraints helps
   * Reminders:
   * Update the wiki with our discussion of today
   * Send us the material you have already written
   * Commit your code to GitLab
   * Think deeper about the distributed aspects of the application, you'll need them, and also about the modularization
---+++ Meeting 24.10.2016
   * Done:
      * Modified LDA to work with ML 
      * Meeting with Chris
      * He suggested that it is better to do preprocessing for each algo on spark and then plug in these components later 
   * Pending
      * CL will have to wait for sometime
      * Start Thesis writing
   * Discuss:
      * Nelder mead algo - find a way to add 
      * Start writing thesis
      * Finish LDA 
      * Built evaluation methods 
      * Find a visualization lib to work either table based or cloud based.  
---+++ Meeting 17.10.2016
   * LDA cannot link constraint not proper
   * Solution??
   * Start with the thesis
   * Concentration parameters ??
   * Meeting with Chris
---+++ Meeting 11.10.2016
   * Added LDA without constraint
   * Finalised paper to add feedback in the constraint
      * Active Learning with Constrained Topic Model 2014
   * TODO: Thesis outline 
   * TODO: LDA with feedback 
   * TODO: Evaluation mechanism so as to calculate accuracy and F1 score   
   * Things Pending:
      * Feedback with the above paper into the implemented LDA 
      * Add code to repository
      * Add preprocessing
---+++ Meeting 05.10.2016
   * AT: Implemented kmean with constraints (https://web.cse.msu.edu/%7Ecse802/notes/ConstrainedKmeans.pdf)
   * AT: Some idea for preprocessing: word2vec(corpus dependent), adding some wikidata or something like that so that sentences have simpler meaning if they represent same context with different words used in sentences. 
      * word embedding look into, implement stop word, lemmatization in spark
   * AT: How to induce novelty in the system 
   * AT: Simple algorithm 'Sicheng Xiong 2014'
   * AT: How to choose most important points given dataset, current clustering, neighbourhood (Paper used entropy mechanism any other idea ??)
   * Few techniques already done farthest datapoint, random, uncertainty (entropy)
   * How to evaluate as dataset is different 
   * Evaluation would be on 2 grounds runtime and quality of cluster (normalized mutual information NMI , F-measure for clustering)
      * Implement some probabilistic clustering methods        
   * !RoadMap:
      *  Week1(3-9)
         * Finalize some feedback mechanism, find some or brainstorm some novel idea
         * Add feedback to kmean clustering (Active learning)
      *  Week2
         * Work on pending issue from previous week
         * Take cluster access UKP
         * Build baseline system (basu et al : Use random data points 2 at a time to get user feedback: Kmean)         
      * Week3:
         * Add preprocessing so to enrich information of each sentences for better clustering
         * Start spectral clustering with constraints 
      * Week4:
         * Add feedback mechanism for spectral clustering (Active learning)
         * Evaluation runtime and NMI and F-measure (Kmean)
      * Week5:
         * Demo UI for the mid-term
         * Finalize the template for the writing part
         * Start writing thesis
         * Evaluation Spec clustering
      * Week6:
         * Demo-UI for the mid-term
         * Start writing thesis
      * Week7:
         * Changes/modifications
      * Week8(21-27)
         * Presentation with evaluation 
      * 29/11/2016: MID-TERM PRESENTATION

---+++ Meeting 12.09.2016
   * Using spark instead of Mahout, as most of the clustering is deprecated and performance of spark is much better than of mahout.
   * BB will contact admin for thesis registration from 15.09
   * BB gave English dataset for initial understanding of clustering outcomes
   * BB will setup next meeting
   * AT has configured his machine for spark applications
   * AT will work on more concrete steps like initial spark driver program to use generate similarity matrix 
   * AT will also find suitable methods for getting similarity scores of sentences as sentence has lower similarity scores due to less word content.
   * AT will check if spark clustering uses similarity matrix as input or vector representation of dataset
  
---+++ Meeting 05.09.2016
   * Reviewed the burocratic issues
      * AT will register the thesis until next week, with a starting date of 01.09
      * Scheduled mid-term and final thesis presentations
   * BB gave to AT the dataset of Prof. Geyken to begin playing with
   * Discussed next steps in the research
   * AT will play with Apache Mahout to see how it could be used
   * AT will also look deeper at Carrot2
   * Next meeting: 12.09
