---++ Annotation Scheme for Sense Link Curation

   * 2 Modes: 
      * validate existing sense links, i.e. annotating existing links as correct/delete
         * retrieve existing links by querying the SenseAxis; display pairs of original sense IDs (not Uby Sense IDs)
         * consequence (not part of the thesis): deletion of sense links in the alignment files (that lists pairs of original sense IDs)
      * validate non-existing links, i.e. annotating pairs of senses that are not linked as correct (when their meaning is not equivalent) or add (there should be a sense link)
         * where pairs of senses are *senses from different lexicons with the same lemma and POS*; calculate all possible candidate sense pairs that are not linked based on their lexical entries in different lexicons and based on the SenseAxis
         * consequence (not part of the thesis): adding the pair of sense links (original sense IDs) to the alignment file
   * Database table !SenseLinkAnnotation
      * ID
      * source: original sense ID (to be found in MonolingualExternalRef)
      * sourceContext: sense definition; alternative context, if a sense definition is missing
      * targetContext: sense definition; alternative context, if a sense definition is missing
      * target: original sense ID (to be found in MonolingualExternalRef)
      * link: yes|no
      * annotation: correct|delete|add
      * user
      * date
