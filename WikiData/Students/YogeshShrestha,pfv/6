      * Things we discussed:
         * Prompting might be an interesting approach
      * ToDo for next week:
         * Next week we will discuss three approaches that are potentially usable as starting points for us (focus on prompting and/or the Geva et al. paper)
         * We also need to discuss how the models we want to use work and how they are trained. I think this is important as a first step (before thinking about how to access their internal knowledge). Please prepare something on that.

   * *2022-12-16 (Week 1)*
      * Things we discussed:
         * What are clarification questions? You found that the definition from literature is not generally applicable to open-domain dialogues. For this reason, we agreed on calling them "knowledge-seeking questions" for now. However, for the final write-up, we have to find a unified term.
         * FITS dataset
         * The task description
      * ToDo for next week:
         * Read the model papers
         * Start to research towards how to identify gaps in model internal knowledge (use section 3, 5, 7 from the survey paper as starting point).
         * We have to identify overlapping dialogues between v1 and v2 of the FITS dataset as ground truth. I will provide you with a proper task description to that by the beginning of next week.
