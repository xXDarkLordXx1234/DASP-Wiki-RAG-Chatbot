      * Things we discussed:
         * What are clarification questions? You found that the definition from literature is not generally applicable to open-domain dialogues. For this reason, we agreed on calling them "knowledge-seeking questions" for now. However, for the final write-up, we have to find a unified term.
         * FITS dataset
         * The task description
      * ToDo for next week:
         * Read the model papers
         * Start to research towards how to identify gaps in model internal knowledge (use section 3, 5, 7 from the survey paper as starting point).
         * We have to identify overlapping dialogues between v1 and v2 of the FITS dataset as ground truth. I will provide you with a proper task description to that by the beginning of next week.
