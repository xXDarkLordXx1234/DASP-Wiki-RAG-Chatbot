---++ Intro

I'm doing my Master thesis here at UKP Labs under the supervision of Hatem Mousselly Sergieh and Prof.Dr. Gurevych. The title of my work is 'Cross Resource Predicate Argument Linking'.

---+++ Topic Description
In my Thesis i aim to develop a Web application based on state of the art indexing and
data visualization techniques supporting enormous number of concurrent users to establish 
novel methods for analyzing frame based predicate­argument structures across a set of
predicate­argument inventories e.g. Framenet flexibly composed from a sense linked lexical
semantic knowledge base. More specifically, our goal is to identify predicate­argument
structure in a given textual unit and link the participants of the structure to corresponding
entities in external knowledge bases or linguistic resource. Furthermore, we focus on cross
resource linking in the sense that the participants of predicate­argument structure are linked to
multiple knowledge bases and lexical resources.

   * todo(): reproduce the resluts of semafor.
      * Re-training on the original corpus
      * Run semafor in server mode on our machine
      * Access the semafor server via API and use it as service for the web application
      * Work on the user interface (web application)
   * todo(HMS): Checking with Raktim if we can use a part of his code for the corpus annotation.
