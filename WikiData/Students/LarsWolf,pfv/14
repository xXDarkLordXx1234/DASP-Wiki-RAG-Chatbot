---++ 05 February 2018
---++++ Done
   * Installed entity linking repo
   * some more work on thesis redaction
   * some improvements to WikiData dataset

---++++ Plans (mostly from last meeting)
   * try entity linking preprocessing on Wikidata dataset
   * add information on when which section of my thesis should be finished
   * get information on when I need to have a confirmation if I passed my thesis

   * convert WebQSP to Wikidata & trainabe format (?)
   * start working on evaluation method for F1 scores

---++ 29 January 2018
---++++ Done
   * mid term presentation
   * some more work on thesis redaction

---++++ Plans (mostly from last meeting)
   * improve WikiData dataset (currently has a very large vocabulary, some queries were not extracted perfectly)
   * try entity linking preprocessing on Wikidata dataset
   * evaluate some hyperparams
   * convert WebQSP to Wikidata & trainabe format (?)
   * start working on evaluation method for F1 scores

---++ 08 January 2018
---++++ Done
   * model is now working on krusty
   * started evaluation
   * added possibility to train model with the created wikidata dataset

---++++ Quesions
   * Data sparsity
     * using template generated data - expanding Leipzig's approach
     * using a Paraphrasing Database (PPDB)
   * is Simple Questions worth a try?
   * WebQSP conversion

---++++ Plans
   * convert WebQSP to trainabe format
   * improve WikiData dataset (currently has a very large vocabulary, some queries were not extracted perfectly)
   * evaluate some hyperparams
   * start working on evaluation method for F1 scores

---++ 18 December 2017
---++++ Done
   * read through much more related work (see [[https://git.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/lwolf/seq2seq4sparql_thesis/blob/master/thesis-lars-wolf.pdf][git]])
   * researched on some more datasets
   * created program to automatically convert wikidata's example queries to header and SPARQL-query (in SPARQL and Leipzig format)
   * Asked Leipzig about including attention in their work (see [[https://github.com/AKSW/NSpM/issues/1][their git]])

---++++ Quesions
   * krusty access?
   * "We" or "I"
   * thesis registration
   * Dataset
      * Web QSP ~3500 question - SPARQL, freebase
      * Simple Questions: mapped to Wikidata
         * needs review, evaluation on what's actually answerable
      * Templates (like Leipzig or [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08760.pdf][Iyer]])
      * data augmentation (like [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.08760.pdf][Iyer]])
   * Model
      * should I create a different Model, or use the options provided by the [[https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt/tree/04c8c04a8b4e805f3d0a9c42b4d17c85f1324c55][tensorflow example for NMT]]
      * Pro TF-NMT: Up-to-date, Attention of Bahdanau already integrated. Provides same model as Google is using for Translation
      * Same model Leipzig is using for their approach

---++++ Plans
   * create Model / adapt model of Leipzig
   * first evaluation of Model
   * try Paraphrase  Database (PPDB) and data augmentation approaches 
   * evaluate semantic parsing papers & relevance

---++ 04 December 2017
---++++ Done
   * Wrote first draft of related work (see [[https://git.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/lwolf/seq2seq4sparql_thesis/blob/master/thesis-lars-wolf.pdf][git]])
   * tested code of Leipzig on my local machine ([[https://github.com/AKSW/NSpM][their git]]
   * tried [[https://github.com/osh/KerasGAN][Keras GAN]]
---++++ Quesions
   * how can I access krusty? (Currently: permission denied)
     * Daniil is organizing Server permissions
   * are GANs promising in that area? How to deal with evaluating ambiguous SPARQL queries? (didn't find method for multiple output options yet)
     * Leave them for no, not to much work on using them for text generation
   * shall I put GANs in related work, even though I might not use them?
---++++ Plans
   * Finish first iteration of related work (&#10004; except for semantic parsers)
   * decide on data type (question -> sparql, leipzig format?)
   * create dataset out of wikipedia entries &#10004;
   * try method of Leipzig to create more data (&#10004; understood, didn't create more yet though)
   * read further into model ideas  &#10004;
   * read into evaluation methods for QA-problems (Bleu? F1 on correct answers? ...?)
   * set up bibtex &#10004; &#10004;

---++ 27 November 2017
   * sign bachelorthesis description &#10004;
   * set up VPN &#10004;
   * get Latex up and running &#10004;
   * read through related work
   * look at webqsp &#10004;
 
---++ 23 November 2017

   * change password &#10004;
   * Read through bachelor thesis description, forward possible changes untill sunday &#10004;
   * set up VPN &#10004;
   * create git repositories  &#10004;
      * thesis &#10004;
      * code &#10004;
