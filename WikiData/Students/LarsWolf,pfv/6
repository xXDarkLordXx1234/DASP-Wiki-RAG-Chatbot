---+ Meetings (monday 14:00)

---++ 04 December 2017
---++++ Done
   * Wrote first draft of related work (see [[https://git.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/lwolf/seq2seq4sparql_thesis/blob/master/thesis-lars-wolf.pdf][git]])
   * tested code of Leipzig on my local machine ([[https://github.com/AKSW/NSpM][their git]]
   * tried [[https://github.com/osh/KerasGAN][Keras GAN]]
---++++ Quesions
   * how can I access krusty? (Currently: permission denied)
     * Daniil is organizing Server permissions
   * are GANs promising in that area? How to deal with evaluating ambiguous SPARQL queries? (didn't find method for multiple output options yet)
     * Leave them for no, not to much work on using them for text generation
   * shall I put GANs in related work, even though I might not use them?
---++++ Plans
   * Finish first iteration of related work
   * decide on data type (question -> sparql, leipzig format?)
   * create dataset out of wikipedia entries
   * try method of Leipzig to create more data
   * read further into model ideas
   * read into evaluation methods for QA-problems (Bleu? F1 on correct answers? ...?)
   * set up bibtex &#10004;

---++ 27 November 2017
   * sign bachelorthesis description &#10004;
   * set up VPN &#10004;
   * get Latex up and running &#10004;
   * read through related work
   * look at webqsp &#10004;
 
---++ 23 November 2017
   * create Wiki page &#10004;
   * change password &#10004;
   * Read through bachelor thesis description, forward possible changes untill sunday &#10004;
   * set up VPN &#10004;
   * create git repositories  &#10004;
      * thesis &#10004;
      * code &#10004;
