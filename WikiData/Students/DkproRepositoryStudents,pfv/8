---+ DKPro repository for students

%TOC%

---++ Most important things to know
   * Repository URL: https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/dkpro_students
<!--   * Repository for external libraries: https://maggie.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/lib
      * *Important*: Do not check in anything here without asking for permission! -->
   * Current UIMA Version: 2.3.0
   * UIMA Data Path in Eclipse: =[PATH_TO_PROJECT]/=

---++ Projects

   * Your supervisor will provide you with a package containing all necessary libraries to start with. The package also contains JARs with the JavaDoc where available.
   * one project for each student

---+++ Project Layout

The project layout should roughly follow the [[http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html][Maven Standard Directory]] Layout:

| src/main/java | Application/Library sources | SD |
| src/main/resources | Application/Library resources | SD |
| src/main/webapp | Web application sources (for web applications only) | |
| src/test/java | Test sources | SD |
| src/test/resources | Test resources | SD |
| doc | Documentation | |
| lib | (when not using Maven) Required libraries. One directory per lib, that contains the jar, the docs, the license, and a link where to download the library | |
| LICENSE.txt | Project's license | |
| README.txt | Project's readme | |

Directories marked as *SD* should be configured as source paths in Eclipse.

When working with UIMA XML descriptors, these should go to the following directories:

| src/main/resources/desc/reader | UIMA descriptors for collection readers |
| src/main/resources/desc/consumer | UIMA descriptors for CAS consumers |
| src/main/resources/desc/annotator | UIMA descriptors for analysis engines |
| src/main/resources/desc/type | UIMA descriptors for annotation types |

---+++ Package names

Classes implementing UIMA components shall go to the following packages:

   * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.student.PROJECT.reader
   * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.student.PROJECT.consumer
   * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.student.PROJECT.annotator
   * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.student.PROJECT.type
   * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.student.PROJECT.resource

At each level, we have a util package that conatins any utils needed and a resources package for needed resources.

---+++ Coding rules

   1 No component may require resources or external software that is not part of the repository.
   1 Quick hacks are done by cloning a component with a name that ends with the initials of the author. (first, put it in the incubator project)
   1 Any big change needs to be discussed with the Group. A change is big if it may change the semantics of a component.
   1 Whenever possible, import by name must be used
   1 We should have unit tests for each component.
