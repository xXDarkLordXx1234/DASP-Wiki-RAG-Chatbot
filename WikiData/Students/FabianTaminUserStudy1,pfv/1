---+ User study 1: process data
---++ Guidelines
   * Target:
      * Knowing the how well the proposed design works and knowing the best user interface design

   * Usability test data type: process data
      * Informal, qualitative observation of what people thinking and doing
      * An overall feeling of what works and what doesn&#8217;t
      * Finding critical incident: points during testing at which participants are confused, frustrated or even swear but also points people are pleasantly surprised or say something positive about the site.

   * Setting up the task:
      * Level of task
      * Should be about what people want to do
         * Not to tell participants how to do the task
      * Task should be realistic

   * Participants
      * Number: 5-6 (max 12)
      * Who:
         * Avoiding friends and family as participants unless you&#8217;re sure they&#8217;ll give honest feedback
         * Don&#8217;t recruit coworker from down the hall.
      * Gifts and prizes
      * Type of experimental design: within-groups experiment

   * Running the test
      * Location: for prototype it can be practically done anywhere
      * Ethical consideration
         * Avoid pressuring people to participate
         * Make clear that the test is voluntary and that participants can stop the test at any time for any reason
         * Make clear that you test the user interface design not the participants themselves
         * If they have problems, it&#8217;s the UI-design fault, not theirs
      * Pilot Test
         * Test with two or three people
         * Coworkers and friends are acceptable
         * Find and work out any bugs in the procedure
         * Find out how long the test takes
            * cut or add more task
      * Testing Paper Prototypes
         * Explaining the concept of paper prototypes
         * Pointing at things using finger as a mouse
      * Starting & carrying out the test
         * Greet participants
            * 3 phases:
               * Instruction & paperwork
               * Performing the  task
               * Debriefing
            * Steps:
               * Introduce yourself
               * Describe the purpose of the test at a high level
               * Emphasize:
                  * We are asking you to help us improve the web site by helping us find problems with it. We&#8217;re testing the web site and not you.
                  * Make clear that you won&#8217;t provide help as participants tackle the task because you want to see how they go through the web site normally.
         * Fill out paperwork
            * Basic demographic information:
               * Name, address
            * Explain how the data will be collected and will be used
         * Ask participants to think aloud
            * If they stop talking asking things like:
               * So, what are you looking for now?
               * What are you trying to do now?
         * Instruct participants on how to start
            * Ask participant if they have any questions before starting
         * Take good notes during each task
            * Take note what each participant says and does
            * If certain task takes far too long, tell the participant that it&#8217;s okay to move on the next task
         * Watch closely
            * Answer any general question that participants may have, but don&#8217;t help them with the tasks
         * Follow up with a quick survey
            * After all the tasks have been completed, follow up with short survey
            * Get the participants&#8217; overall impression and comments about the web site, asking what they liked and disliked about that.
         * Debrief participants after test
            * Discussing interesting behavior on the participant&#8217;s part
               * Go through the web site again to help prompt their memory

   * Analyzing the data
      * What you saw and what participants said
      * Improving prototype:
         * Reduce confusion:
            * Rename things using familiar language
            * Explain them in greater detail
         * Reduce errors and error recovery:
            * Descriptive, longer link names, which provide more information-scent to help participants find a particular page.
            * Clear form that helps prevent errors
            * Meaningful error message
         * Navigation
            * Multiple ways to navigate

      * Important things to analyze:
         * Why the error occurred
         * Was the navigation to confusing
         * Was the information disorganized
         * Was the page to cluttered

         * Executive summary
            * Quick overview, what you did in the test, summary of the result, run down of the recommendation for improvements
         * Tasks
            * What task you carried out

         * Suggested improvements
            * What needs to be changed to improve the website
            * Categorize it to:
               * Must do
                  * Serious problems if it&#8217;s not recovered
               * Should do
                  * Problems are annoying but tolerable

                  * Benefit at recovery (keep this for next iteration)
         * Appendixes
            * Any test materials used during the experiment (demo scripts, instructions, forms)

   * Rating the importance of each feature
      * 1 (not important) to 7 (very important)
