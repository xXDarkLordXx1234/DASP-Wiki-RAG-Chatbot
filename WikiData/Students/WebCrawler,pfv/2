---+ Web Crawler

---++ Current Design
   * State: Current URL, queue for links, visited and stored URLs, history of past N followed links
   * Actions: Store current page, follow unvisited links directly, store unvisited links to queue, follow link from queue, return to any of the N past links.
   * Rewards: -0.001 for adding a link to the queue, +/-0.01 for visiting a relevant/irrelevant link and +/-1.0 for storing relevant/irrelevant URLs.
   * Future Rewards: Discount factor of 0.25. Will be increased when crawler performance improves.
   * Predictions: The observed reward from past actions is stored and future reward predicted through supervised learning.

---++ Issues
   * Normalization of URLs - resolved
   * Error codes and connection timeouts - resolved
   * Irrelevant content such as rss feeds - partially resolved (can't always detect from URL)
   * Irrelevant file types (images, audio, video) and preventing from downloading them - partially resolved (s.o.)
   * Dead ends (e.g., sequence of pages with too few unvisited links) - in progress

---++ Current Features
The following features represent the perspective of the source of a link, since we only want to load a document, if it is promising. So all document features are calculated for the link source, not the actual document. The document features only represent the current document, when we've loaded it and want to decide to store it or not. URL-related features are computed for the source _and_ target of a domain.

| *Feature* | *Description* | *Relevance** |
| actionType | - | tbd |
| lastRewards | Statistics regarding the rewards for the links that lead to the current situation. | tbd |
| rewardHistoryDomain | Statistics about the past rewards for actions on the given domain. Also, how many documents from that domain we already visited/stored. | tbd |
| rewardHistoryKnn | Rewards for past actions, with similarity based on features and text similarity. | tbd |
| topLevelDomain | Is it .de, .com, .org, etc.? | tbd |
| hostnameLength | The length of the main host identifier, without subdomain | tbd |
| subdomainLength | Length of subdomain name, if it exists. | tbd |
| domainPageRank | Only if there are free APIs which allow to request as many domain names as we require. | tbd |
| googleStatistics | Total number of results for domain, number of backlinks, etc. | tbd |
| alexaStatistics | Statistics from Alexa.com, if there is a suitable API. | tbd |
| documentLength | Length of the entire text. Without HTML code. | tbd |
| stopwordsRatio | Ratio of stopwords found in the document. | tbd |
| documentTextSimilarity | Similarity between the text and the texts / keywords in the training corpus. | tbd |
| documentReadability | FleschÂ–Kincaid Grade Level of the text, or similar. | tbd |
| documentLanguage | Since TLD is not always reliable, we might identify the document language. | tbd |
| contentType | We might include extra predictors, trained on content type, like "official"/government, business, Web 2.0, newspapers, etc. | tbd |
| tagStatistics | For HTML documents, how often do certain tags appear, e.g., images and outgoing links. | tbd |
| linkPosition | The position of the link within the document. | tbd |
| linkAttributes | How long is "alt" attribute, does it wrap a text or image, etc.? | tbd |
| linkSameDomain | Does the link point to the same domain? | tbd |
| linkTargetType | If we can tell from the URL, is the target a website, PDF, etc.? | tbd |
| linkTextKnn | Comparison with past rewards, based on similarity of text surrounding the link. | tbd |

* Relevance measures for features will be given soon.

---++ Evaluation
 As currently the rewards are stored for all actions in order to build a model, we can use a traditional supervised learning setup (e.g., crossvalidation) to evaluate how fell future rewards are predicted by the model. The ultimate crawler performance will be measured through IE metrics with the Bildungsserver database as our gold standard.
