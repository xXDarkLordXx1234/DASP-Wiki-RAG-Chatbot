---++ Current and Past Entries

| *Week* | *Original Plan / Milestone Log* |
| 3 | Implementation of evaluation functions and benchmarks; implementation of further features for all tasks; preparations for implementing competitive systems; notes on all keywords-related papers. |
| 2 | Formalization of decision processes; collection of benchmarks and baselines; design of additional evaluation functions; design and implementation of an evaluation and reporting framework; notes on all web crawling papers. |
| 1 | Migration of current notes into Wiki; thesis outline; patent search and collection of related work; software and code repository setup. |
| | 18.10.: Frameworks for dossier extraction and single-/multi-document summarization completed; no features yet. |
| | 11.10.: First working version of keyword assignment and its evaluation. Again, proper features will be required for good results. |
| | 8.10.: Working version of crawler incl. multiple reinforcement learning algorithms and experimentation/evaluation framework. Now requires sophisticated features. |

---++ Detailed Reports

---+++ Week 3, 29.10.
   * Implemented term similarity using term document matrices based on variable frequency measures.
   * Baselines: Random Selection, First N Candidates Selection, Similarity-Based Selection, Term Frequency Selection, Optimal Selection Baseline, framework for Supervised Learning baselines.
   * Additional evaluation functions for ranking and metrics based on term distribution / term similarity measures.
   * Building a web graph around the Bildungsserver URLs is still in progress since crawling search engines for backlinks gets us blocked after a few dozen requests.
   * General improvement on the current framework (mainly data preprocessing) and the state of the single approaches (e.g., term similarity features).
   * Rest of the week:
      * Continue to work on the web graphs.
      * Implementation of remaining baselines and metrics for document summarization.
      * Redesign of evaluation website to deal with the larger quantities of evaluation functions.
      * Notes on all keywords-related papers

---+++ Week 2, 22.10.
   * There are 1000s of model updates and at least 100,000 state-action-value predictions for one simulation of keyword assignment using RL:
      * Remodeled framework to optimize balance between reusing in-memory data and not running out of memory.
      * Made a few 3rd-party regression algorithms use my own data objects to avoid overhead from the adapters to their original libraries.
   * Implemented framework to be able to centrally define and combine configurations/parameters for data/features, model/approach and simulation.
   * Almost completed website for comparing performance on each task and over time (link follows).
   * Rest of the week:
      * Collection and design of benchmarks/baselines/objective functions for all tasks.
      * Add Wiki pages for all tasks and update methodology on current pages.
      * Notes on focused crawling papers.

---+++ Week 1, 15.10.
   * Initial collection of related work.
   * Completed framework for extraction and summarization, including process formulation for all 5 tasks.
   * Implementation of more features for web crawling and keyword assignment.
   * Implemented solutions for PDF parsing errors and spelling/encoding issues.
   * Transfer of relevant past notes into Wiki.
