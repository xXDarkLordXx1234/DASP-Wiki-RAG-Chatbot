---+!! Master Thesis: Predicting Depression Severity from Therapy Dialogues


---++  Next Week: #5, October 9th - 15th
   * todos (for next two weeks probably):
      * wip: fine-tuning sled on daic - read model, evaluate 
      * create other DAIC dataset (with depression levels)
      * re-engineering Unlimiformer... How to use, fine-tune, train ..? on custom data set
      * next week: Landmark attention
      * start to write something down....
      * run base model on daic 
      * create MPI data set

---++  Week: #4, October 2th - 8th
   * run fine-tuning for SLED on an example data set (seems to work)
   * run fine-tuning for SLED on a DAIC data set (pro question) - wip
   * create data visualizations
   * MPI data set: get access to the output data (access there, but data still not on the cluster) 
   * MPI: create environment etc and run first model (was killed after one day bc of time limits)
   * MPI data set: try to create a data set  

---++  Week #3, September 25th - October 1th
   * Literatur Review on Depression Severity prediction
   * Process DAIC data (create train and test data sets in HF format)
   * First look (access since few days) at MPI data
   * Re-engineering SLED to understand the correct data preparation for fine-tuning (wip)

---++  Week #2, September 18th - 24th
   * Writing and Literatur Review (wip) on:
      * Text Classification
   * Run SLED (locally)
   * Connect to slurm, download all code bases 
   * Applied for Datasets

---++  Week #1, September 11th - 17th
   * Literatur Review (wip) on:
      * Text Classification
      * Depression Severity Prediction 
      * Long(ish) Text Processing
      * SOTA Language Models
   * Problem: none of the models considered (SLED, Unlmiformer, Landmark Attention) supports pure classification (or regression) task

---++  Week #0, September 4th - 10th
   * Environment set up
      * Download the code base from the main three papers
      * Install VS Code, Github, Tex Live
   * Literatur Review (work in progress):
      * Long transformers
      * Long transformers that do not need to be re-trained
      * Depression Severity Prediction & NLP
   * First Code attempts
      * install Unlimiformer
         * update Unlimiformer & make pull-request
         * Problem: Unlimformer does not support pure Classification or Regression models
      * install SLED
