---+!! Master Thesis: Predicting Depression Severity from Therapy Dialogues

---++  Week #2, September 18th - 24th
   * Writing and Literatur Review (wip) on:
      * Text Classification
   * Run SLED (locally)
   * Connect to slurm, download all code bases 
   * Applied for Datasets

---++  Week #1, September 11th - 17th
   * Literatur Review (wip) on:
      * Text Classification
      * Depression Severity Prediction 
      * Long(ish) Text Processing
      * SOTA Language Models
   * Problem: none of the models considered (SLED, Unlmiformer, Landmark Attention) supports pure classification (or regression) task

---++  Week #0, September 4th - 10th
   * Environment set up
      * Download the code base from the main three papers
      * Install VS Code, Github, Tex Live
   * Literatur Review (work in progress):
      * Long transformers
      * Long transformers that do not need to be re-trained
      * Depression Severity Prediction & NLP
   * First Code attempts
      * install Unlimiformer
         * update Unlimiformer & make pull-request
         * Problem: Unlimformer does not support pure Classification or Regression models
      * install SLED
