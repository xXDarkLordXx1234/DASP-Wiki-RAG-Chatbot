---+ Single-Document Summarization

---++ Current Design
   * State: Current sentences in their order of selection.
   * Actions: Add sentence to the end, remove a sentence from any position, stop process.
   * Rewards: Difference between ROUGE scores for the current summary before and after the action.
   * Future Rewards: Discount factor of 0.25. Will be increased when performance improves.
   * Predictions: The observed reward from past actions is stored and future reward predicted through supervised learning.
   * In a later version, we will use a hierarchy of reinforcement models and will allow to generate sentences as an action.

---++ Current Features

| *Feature* | *Description* | *Relevance** |
| actionType | Whether this action adds a sentence, removes it or finishes the process. | tbd |
| summaryLength | Current length of summary in terms of sentences, words and characters. | tbd |
| summaryWordTypes | Statistics for various word type frequencies, e.g., stop words and named entities. | tbd |
| summaryTextSimilarity | Various similarity measures for the summary and the original text after the action and also the differences to the state before the action. | tbd |
| sentenceLength | Number of words and characters for the sentence to be added or removed. | tbd |
| sentencePosition | The position within the summary if this action removes the sentence. | tbd |
| sentencePositionText | The position of the sentence within the text. | tbd |
| sentenceWordTypes | Statistics for various word type frequencies, e.g., stop words and named entities. | tbd |
| sentenceSummarySimilarity | Various similarity measures between the sentence and the summary as a whole, as well as similarity statistics (mean/max) for per-sentence comparison. | tbd |
| sentenceTextSimilarity | Various similarity measures between the sentence and the original text. | tbd |
| sentenceProximity | What is the mean/min/max distance between the action's sentence and sentences in the summary, measured by numbers of sentences separating them in the original text. | tbd |

* Relevance measures for features will be given soon.

---++ Evaluation

   * Weighted Edit Distance: How many sentences have to be rearranged, added or removed to obtain the original summary?
   * ROUGE
   * Bag-of-Words similarity using cosine, Jaccard, term similarity, etc.
   * Semantic Similarity: Finds metrics which measure how similar the content is.
   * Linguistic Correctness: Find metrics for cohesion of generated language.
   * Coherence: Does the summary make sense?
