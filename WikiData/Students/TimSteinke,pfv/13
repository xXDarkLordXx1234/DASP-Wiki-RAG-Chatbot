---+ Tim Steinke (Bachelor Thesis)
Generating Questions From Knowledge Bases
---++ CW39 2018-09-23 - 2018-09-29
   * Implemented more metrics:
      * Meteor
      * Embedding Greedy
      * Global Recall
   * Requirements management with Pipenv and Git Submodules
   * Read “Measuring the Diversity of Automatic Image Descriptions” by [[http://aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1147][van Miltenburg et al. 2018]]
---++ CW38 2018-09-16 - 2018-09-22
   * Finished implementing the “Template-Based Baseline”
   * Started improving the baseline by implementing ranking heuristics for the generated questions
   * Started evaluating the baseline using automatic evaluation metrics
   * Reserved a slot for my mid-term presentation on 2018-12-11
   * *TODO*
      * Evaluate on more metrics
      * Find better ranking heuristics
      * Start using Pipenv and Git submodules to improve the requirements management
---++ CW37 2018-09-09 - 2018-09-15
   * Read recent paraphrasing approaches
   * Started implementing the “Template-Based Baseline” from [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06807.pdf][Serban et al. 2016]] (Section 4.5)
   * *Meeting 2018-09-13*
      * Next steps:
         * Implement baselines and test them via a user study
         * Extrinsic evaluation on Daniil's QA system
      * Enter a date for the mid-term talk on the spreadsheet

---++ CW36 2018-09-02 - 2018-09-08
   * Read dataset migration approaches:
      * Azmy et al. 2018 “Farewell Freebase: Migrating the <nowiki>SimpleQuestions</nowiki> Dataset to DBpedia”
      * Diefenbach et al. 2017 “Question Answering Benchmarks for Wikidata” (Freebase->Wikidata)
   * Read about automatic evaluation methods:
      * Papineni et al. 2001 “BLEU : a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation”
      * Lin 2004 “ROUGE : A Package for Automatic Evaluation of Summaries”
      * Banerjee et al. 2005 “METEOR: An Automatic Metric for MT Evaluation with Improved Correlation with Human Judgments”
      * Denkowski et al. 2014 “Meteor Universal: Language Specific Translation Evaluation for Any Target Language”
   * Started ordering the literature and datasets in a mindmap to keep a good overview

---++ CW33 2018-08-12 - 2018-08-18
   * Read the [[https://github.com/allenai/acl2018-semantic-parsing-tutorial][ACL 2018 tutorial on neural semantic parsing]] that Jan sent me

---++ CW32 2018-08-05 - 2018-08-11
   * Started doing some [[https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials][of these]] deep learning tutorials that were interesting
   * *Meeting 2018-08-10*
      * Submitted my thesis application
      * Talked about the literature I read last week and Freebase -> Wikidata mapping
      * Daniil gave me access to the repository for UKP's local SPARQL endpoint 
   * *TODO*
      * Read the semantic parsing tutorial Jan sent me
      * Read about paraphrasing methods (e.g. Backtranslating)
      * Find a way to access the SPARQL endpoint from outside the UKP network (SSH or VPN)

---++ CW31 2018-07-29 - 2018-08-04
   * Read state-of-the-art approaches:
      * Seyler et al. 2015 “Generating Quiz Questions from Knowledge Graphs,”
      * Song et al. 2016 “Question Generation from a Knowledge Base with Web Exploration.”
   * Read Bordes et al. 2015 “Large-Scale Simple Question Answering with Memory Networks.” and downloaded the SimpleQuestions Dataset
   * Recapped some core concepts from the Stanford Deep Learning for NLP course that I have gone through in april
   


---++ CW30 2018-07-22 - 2018-07-28
   * Recapped some of the introductory literature that Daniil sent me, transferring my notes to Zotero
   * Read up on baselines from Zero-Shot QG (Elsahar et al. 2018)
   * *Meeting 2018-07-25*
      * We discussed my roadmap for august
      * UKP has a Wikidata dump and a paraphrasing server that I can maybe get access to 
      * *TODO*
         * Fill out the application form for the thesis and bring it to the next meeting
         * Schedule the next meeting before Jan leaves at 2018-08-13

---++ CW29 2018-07-15 - 2018-07-21
   * Set up the thesis template, Biblatex, and integrated it with Zotero
   * Installed Keras & Theano
   * Experimented with the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint and wrote a very simple template based question generator
   * Downloaded a Wikidata dump
   * Read up on some state-of-the-art approaches

---++ 2018-07-04 Meeting
   * Task description was accepted
   * Next meeting on 2018-07-25
   * *TODO*
      * Set up Latex Template and Biblatex
      * Start logging my progress and goals on this wiki page
      * Start searching for baselines, state-of-the-art, and evaluation methods
      * Create a roadmap of my future steps for the next meeting
