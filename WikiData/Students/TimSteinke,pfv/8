---+ Tim Steinke (Bachelor Thesis)
Generating Questions From Knowledge Bases
---++ CW32 2018-08-05 - 2018-08-11
   * Started doing some [[https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials][of these]] deep learning tutorials that were interesting
   * *Meeting 2018-07-25*
      * Submitted my thesis application
      * Talked about the literature I read last week and Freebase -> Wikidata mapping
      * Daniil gave me access to the repository for UKP's local SPARQL endpoint 
   * TODO:
      * Read the semantic parsing tutorial Jan sent me
      * Read about paraphrasing methods (e.g. Backtranslating)
      * Find a way to access the SPARQL endpoint from outside the UKP network (SSH or VPN)

---++ CW31 2018-07-29 - 2018-08-04
   * Read state-of-the-art approaches:
      * Seyler et al. 2015 “Generating Quiz Questions from Knowledge Graphs,”
      * Song et al. 2016 “Question Generation from a Knowledge Base with Web Exploration.”
   * Read Bordes et al. 2015 “Large-Scale Simple Question Answering with Memory Networks.” and downloaded the SimpleQuestions Dataset
   * Recapped some core concepts from the Stanford Deep Learning for NLP course that I have gone through in april
   


---++ CW30 2018-07-22 - 2018-07-28
   * Recapped some of the introductory literature that Daniil sent me, transferring my notes to Zotero
   * Read up on baselines from Zero-Shot QG (Elsahar et al. 2018)
   * *Meeting 2018-07-25*
      * We discussed my roadmap for august
      * UKP has a Wikidata dump and a paraphrasing server that I can maybe get access to 
      * *TODO*
         * Fill out the application form for the thesis and bring it to the next meeting
         * Schedule the next meeting before Jan leaves at 2018-08-13

---++ CW29 2018-07-15 - 2018-07-21
   * Set up the thesis template, Biblatex, and integrated it with Zotero
   * Installed Keras & Theano
   * Experimented with the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint and wrote a very simple template based question generator
   * Downloaded a Wikidata dump
   * Read up on some state-of-the-art approaches

---++ 2018-07-04 Meeting
   * Task description was accepted
   * Next meeting on 2018-07-25
   * *TODO*
      * Set up Latex Template and Biblatex
      * Start logging my progress and goals on this wiki page
      * Start searching for baselines, state-of-the-art, and evaluation methods
      * Create a roadmap of my future steps for the next meeting
