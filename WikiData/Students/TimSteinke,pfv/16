---+ Tim Steinke (Bachelor Thesis)
Generating Questions From Knowledge Bases
---++ CW44 2018-10-28 - 2018-11-03
   * Calculated silvergraphs for the template-based baseline's questions
   * Tried reproducing Daniil's results on a GPU server, but got nowhere near
   * Todo:
      * See if using a better entity linker works and why it finished training so quickly with the default settings
      * Also work on the other steps from the last entry
---++ CW43 2018-10-21 - 2018-10-27
   * *Meeting 2018-10-24*
      * Next steps:
         * Improve the template based baseline by only considering templates that were generated from questions that have the same entity types as the input entities
         * Apply [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06842][Zero-Shot QG (Elsahar et al. 2018)]] to <nowiki>SimpleQuestions</nowiki>-Wikidata
         * Try to reproduce Daniil's results and see if questions from the template-based baseline or Zero-Shot improve the results
---++ CW42 2018-10-14 - 2018-10-20
   * Set up an environment on a compute server
   * Calculated silver graphs for Webquestions-Wikidata and questions from the template based baseline for training Daniil's system
---++ CW41 2018-10-07 - 2018-10-13
   * Started getting Daniil's model to work with the first question generation baseline for extrinsic evaluation
   * Finished adding the Taylor's law based metric
---++ CW40 2018-10-30 - 2018-10-06
   * Read “Taylor’s Law for Human Linguistic Sequences” by [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07893.pdf][Kobayashi and Tanaka-Ishii]] and started adding their Taylor-exponent based metric

   * Implemented more metrics:
      * Meteor
      * Embedding Greedy
      * Global Recall
   * Requirements management with Pipenv and Git Submodules
   * Read “Measuring the Diversity of Automatic Image Descriptions” by [[http://aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1147][van Miltenburg et al. 2018]]
---++ CW38 2018-09-16 - 2018-09-22
   * Finished implementing the “Template-Based Baseline”
   * Started improving the baseline by implementing ranking heuristics for the generated questions
   * Started evaluating the baseline using automatic evaluation metrics
   * Reserved a slot for my mid-term presentation on 2018-12-11
   * *TODO*
      * Evaluate on more metrics
      * Find better ranking heuristics
      * Start using Pipenv and Git submodules to improve the requirements management
---++ CW37 2018-09-09 - 2018-09-15
   * Read recent paraphrasing approaches
   * Started implementing the “Template-Based Baseline” from [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.06807.pdf][Serban et al. 2016]] (Section 4.5)
   * *Meeting 2018-09-13*
      * Next steps:
         * Implement baselines and test them via a user study
         * Extrinsic evaluation on Daniil's QA system
      * Enter a date for the mid-term talk on the spreadsheet

---++ CW36 2018-09-02 - 2018-09-08
   * Read dataset migration approaches:
      * Azmy et al. 2018 “Farewell Freebase: Migrating the <nowiki>SimpleQuestions</nowiki> Dataset to DBpedia”
      * Diefenbach et al. 2017 “Question Answering Benchmarks for Wikidata” (Freebase->Wikidata)
