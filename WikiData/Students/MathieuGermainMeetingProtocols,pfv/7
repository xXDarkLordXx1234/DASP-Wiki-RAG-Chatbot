---++ Meeting 13.7.09
   * UIMA tf*idf component working?

---++ Meeting 8.7.2009
   * wrapper too much effort (too many libraries, parameters, etc.)
   * instead: continue MMR

---++ Meeting 6.7.2009
   * Finish CPE , add baselineNIST, done
   * plan:
      * 1. continue working on UIMA wrapper for time word identification program (what was the name of the program?)
      * 2. statistics of words (term frequency of nouns; perhaps also adjectives)
      * 3. inverse document frequency -> tf*idf
   * for evaluation: have a look at ROUGE & model files from TAC08

---++ Meeting 29.6.2009
   * TAC reader done
   * Continue to look for existing Time Expression identification 
   * Finish CPE , add baselineNIST

---++ Meeting 22.6.2009
   * TAC reader nearly done; question: MG: more features including? JC: no
   * JC: do you need a grade? MG: no, just success/fail
   * identification of temporal expressions
   * fax done for money transfer
   * *plan*
      * finish TAC Reader; 
         * Paragraph + Warnings  
      * build CPE (or java code) TAC reader + preprocessing components (UkpSentenceSplitter, UkpTokenizer, TreeTagger (part-of-speech annotation))
      * have a look at AnnotationViewer
      * put statistics for temporal expressions in wiki
      * if time: start with temporal annotation program
         * before: have a look if there already exist programs for temporal expression identification which we could reuse

---++ Meeting 15.6.2009
   * get TAC reader to work
   * SVN works, DKPro works
   * same items as last week

---++ Meeting 8.6.2009
   * plan:
      * enhance TAC reader
      * UIMA preprocessing pipeline
      * tf*idf baseline
