---+!! Sentence Clustering
---++++ Master Thesis of Rouven RÃ¶hrig

This page contains results of the 'sentence clustering data analysis'.

---++++ Description
In this analysis I've used DKPro with the similarity package to generate clusters of similar sentences.
I've implemented a pipeline which reads error messages (simple self-defined xml format).
Different consumers create clusters of similar sentences based on a TextSimilarityMeasureBase and thresholds.
A writer outputs the clusters (self-defined xml format) along with simple statistics.

---++++ Statistics
*Definitions*:
   * Cluster := a cluster consists of a 'base sentence' and a set of member sentence.
   * Base sentence := Every member of the cluster is similar with respect to the base sentence.
   * Member sentence := a member is a sentence with is similar to the base sentence (the base sentence is also a member).
   * Enclave (n) := an enclave is a cluster which contains _n_ members only (default n=1; then the member is the base sentence itself).
      * Note: some setups define an enclave as a cluster with one or two members only.
   * Real cluster := a real cluster contains at least two members.

---++++ Statistics
The following measures have been used:
   * Number of enclaves
   * Number of real clusters
   * Average real cluster size:= number of real clusters / number of all members of all real clusters

*Enclave examples related to the biggest cluster of Test 2a and 2b:*
<verbatim>
Please check the exception message and take necessary action.
Analyze the enclosed exception.
See the embedded exception description.
</verbatim>
As we can see, the enclaves are very close but don't follow the standard pattern.
