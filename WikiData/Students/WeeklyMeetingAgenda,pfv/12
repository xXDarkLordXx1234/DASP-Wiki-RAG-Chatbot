-- Main.GeorgiValkanov - 2012-12-03
---+++ Meeting 12.02.2013

Separation of the questions into categories

   * Category 1 
      * Answers are part of a specific well-defined group of terms (taxonomy)
      * The answers share a common straight-forward property
   * Category 2
      * Answers share a property that is untypical, ambiguous od depends on additional logical conclusions 
   * Category 3
      * Elements a synonyms ( adjectives or verbs) therefore they don't build taxonomies in WordNet and some measures are undefined for them
   * Category 4
      * The odd one out answer is a general term and the rest are specializations or products of this term.

Status update:

Analyzed performance of GlossOverlap and Resnik similarity measures.

Several insights:

   * GlossOverlap works well on the verbs, whereas all path-based measures fail
   * GlossOverlap often doesn't have values for simple words
   * Path-based algorithms have more often meaningful values
   * Problems with plural forms, complex words, plural forms
   * giving 1/2 or 1/3 points will only increase performance slightly
Split up of the questions in categories

   * Sinonyms - the ooo is not a sinonym of the rest
   * Taxonomies - the ooo is not part of the taxonomy
   * Shared properties - the ooo does'n share the same property as the rest
   * General term and specialization - the ooo is the general term (too few questions)
Run sim. measures on categories

   * GlossOverlap - Sinonyms (66%), Taxonomy (41%), Properties (34%)
   * Resnik - Sinonyms (skipped), Taxonomy (70%), Properties (34%)

---+++ Meeting on 11.12.2012
   * Question quality? - Some questions are way too easy for humans. Should we consider those as well?
   * SemanticSimilarity ?

---+++ Meeting on 04.12.2012
   * How many questions needed in the corpus?
   * Question solver 
      * wia semantic relatedness (WordNet, Roget's Thesaurus)
      * other way?
   * Question generator 
      * Wiki-based?
      * or similar to solver - get N similar concepts, chose N+1th with a bigger distance to the rest?

Open Questions:

   * How to determine the PoS of the answers? Is this needed for the similarity check?
   * Why are some of the comparators very slow and Java runs out of memory?
   * How do I use the serialized graphs? Can a LSR be created from them?
   * Is similarity reflexive?
Discuss:

   * Questionare results
   * First solver results
   * Algorithms and implementation
