I know it is expensive, but it is the best out in the market.</content><ASIN>B000A2BJ76</ASIN><rating>5</rating><total_votes>0</total_votes></review><review><customer_id>A2A8Z8YFM3HJ76</customer_id><review_date>2008-03-26</review_date><content>There's nothing to complain about the genuine ink cartridge. You could refill it with the refill ink, just do it before the genuine ink exhausts.</content><ASIN>B000A2BJ76</ASIN><rating>5</rating><total_votes>0</total_votes></review><review><customer_id>A1OY9Q926YQRRR</customer_id><review_date>2008-03-18</review_date><content>I figure that printer manufacturers depend on ink to keep us as customers. Generally we look at the results rather than the equipment. I'm comfortable spending a little more for the manufacturer's inks, because they're formulated to get the best out of the printers. After a few minutes shopping on Amazon, I wound up with a very good price, including shipping, and I had it a few days after ordering. Can't beat that.</content><ASIN>B000A2BJ76</ASIN><rating>5</rating><total_votes>0</total_votes></review><review><customer_id>A21PXHRXC4368K</customer_id><review_date>2008-03-01</review_date><content>Received the cartridge in a very short time.
&lt;br /&gt;Always an excellent provider. Amazon is the way to go.</content><ASIN>B000A2BJ76</ASIN><rating>5</rating><total_votes>0</total_votes></review><review><customer_id>A39FPCF7OXDU70</customer_id><review_date>2008-02-26</review_date><content>I ordered the cartridge and had to email to find out why it hadn't shipped when the black one (ordered @ same time) did.
&lt;br /&gt;I was told it was no longer available from the supplier and that I would be refunded.
&lt;br /&gt;Almost 1 month after order the cartridge is still showing as "shipped" in my order history the only way I know I didn't get stuck with the payment is to check the credit card history.
&lt;br /&gt;I'm disappointed, Amazon usually does such a Great Job getting their products out or getting in touch with me if there is a snag.
&lt;br /&gt;I feel they dropped the ball on this order. </content><ASIN>B000A2BJ76</ASIN><rating>2</rating><total_votes>1</total_votes></review></reviews></item>
