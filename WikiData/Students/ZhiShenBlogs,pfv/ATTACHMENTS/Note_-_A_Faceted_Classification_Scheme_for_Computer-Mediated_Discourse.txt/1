CMD (Computer Media Discourse)

Simultaneously, the focus of much CMD research shifted to describing the linguistic features of
individual genres of CMD, e.g., email discussion lists, Usenet newsgroups, Internet Relay Chat
(IRC), and MUDs.1 Elsewhere, I have termed these “socio-technical modes” (Herring 2002) –
following Murray’s (1988) use of the term “mode” to refer to technologically-defined CMC
subtypes – to reflect the fact that labels such as “IRC”, “Usenet”, “email”, and so forth are
commonly understood to refer not just to CMC systems, but also to the social and cultural
practices that have arisen around their use.  (p.3)

The approach to the classification of computer-mediated discourse proposed in this article
is based on multiple categories or “facets”. (p.4)

The CMD classification scheme is a core component of the computer-mediated discourse analysis
(CMDA) approach developed by Herring (2001, 2004a);4 the scheme is presented here in detail
for the first time. CMDA adapts methods from the study of spoken and written discourse to
computer-mediated communication data. Similarly, the central role of classification in CMDA can
be traced back to traditional discourse analytic concerns. (p.4)

Faceted classification is an approach to the organization of information with origins in the field of library and information science. (p.9)

Medium factors (p.13)

Most CMC systems add new messages
to the bottom of a list in the order received by the system, although this is not true of blogs (which
add the newest message on the top), wikis (which allow users to choose where their content will
be inserted), or some experimental systems. (p.17)

Situation factors (p.17)

Blogs have been characterized as a genre of CMC (Herring et al. 2004; Miller & Shepherd 2004)MD.pdf
