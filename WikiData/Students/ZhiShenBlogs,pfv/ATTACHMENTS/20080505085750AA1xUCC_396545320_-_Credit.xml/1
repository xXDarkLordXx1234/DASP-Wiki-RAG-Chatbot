It all depends on your personal credit rating. The biggest challenge is finding one that offers the lowest interest rate.There are various routes to explore when seeking out a bad credit student loan and I would suggest that your first port of call would be the school for which you are about to attend. You will need to fill out a FAFSA form in order to initially apply for a federal loan. Perkins loans are combined school and government funds. A combination loan may be another alternative way of acquiring a bad credit student loan. This type of student loan enables you to consolidate&lt;!--any existing loans that you have whilst applying for a new tuition loan. The only drawback to this type of loan is that you may need someone to co-sign.Another way to get a bad credit student loan is to get a co-signer. Maybe a family member with good credit would help. This way you could get loans with more attractive interest rates and terms, in spite of your bad credit. You may find the student loan here,

Finally, if all else fails you will need to contact banks and financial institutions. They will more than likely be happy to lend you the money, but it will be on a higher interest rate than usual. When you have bad credit the banks will check out your personal credit score first and then offer terms based on the credit rating assessment. Take heart, even if your bad credit student loan is set at a high interest rate, numerous--&gt;student loans defer your payment until you have finished college. This in turn will allow you time to improve your credit rating and when you leave college you could then look into consolidating your bad credit student loan at a better interest rate. This will mean your monthly payments will be at a lower level and therefore more affordable.</content><reference></reference><user_id></user_id><answer_date>2008-05-05 09:39:48</answer_date></answer><answer><content>Go to the school's Financial Aid office, ask to see a counselor (you may need an appointment) and ask what they can recommend for you.  

It's tough right now, b/c with the housing situation, even student loans, which were rarely refused before, are becoming hard to obtain.  

You didn't mention if you're married, involved, or a single mother - as a single mother, if this is the case, there may be some assistance programs in your area.  Either the financial aid office should be able to point you in the right direction or, if you look up any related single mother assistance group online/in the phone book, they can probably point you to the "right" one to ask for help (if there is a right one for you)</content><reference></reference><user_id></user_id><answer_date>2008-05-05 10:02:50</answer_date></answer><answer><content>Hello,
