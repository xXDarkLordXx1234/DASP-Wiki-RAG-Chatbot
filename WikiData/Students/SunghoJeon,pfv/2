---++ Meeting 2018-5-2


---++ Project idea:
   **Multi-hop inference combining information from raw text and a knowledge base*
   * Combine raw text and knowledge base: Semantic parsing, join entity linking relation matching
   * Data sets: FEVER, WikiHop, MultiHop: Constructing Datasets for Multi-hop Reading Comprehension Across Documents https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06481.pdf
   * Relevant related work: Work by Seb Riedel and Röckteschel

---++ Project constraints:

   **Prof Gurevych's ideas for the project*
   * Enhancing information present in raw text with information from a knowledge base and apply reasoning techniques to solve a task
   * For this purpose the following problems must be solved:
      * Transforming a text into a logical forms (possibly represented by embeddings)
      * Grounding of the derived logical forms in a knowledge base: entity linking, relation matching
      * Joint inference: Reasoning over the information from the knowledge base and the text
