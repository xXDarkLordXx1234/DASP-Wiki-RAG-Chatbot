Gurevych: Knowledge bases, reasoning, inference on the basis of knowledge bases and raw text

Alternative approach deep learning approach memory netowrks: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.07285.pdf

Andreas: Claim validation, collect evidence semantic parsing and information from knowledge base in order to validate claims

People to talk to: Daniil expert on semantic parsing, knowledge bases





-----------------------------------

Summary: combine raw text and knowledge base: Semantic parsing, join entity linking relation matching

Related work for join entity linking relation matching: http://xren7.web.engr.illinois.edu/www17-CoType.pdf

Need to determine: dataset: FEVER, WikiHop, MultiHop, ...


Extracting reasoning chains for multihop reasoning for claim validation

Information aggregation: extracting of evidence, semantic parsing combining with knowledge base and reasoning

Ask Todor for paper: Enhancing Cloze-Style Reading Comprehension with External Common Sence Knowledge (wordnet) using Explicit Key-Value Memory

---++ Project idea:
   **Multi-hop inference combining information from raw text and a knowledge base*

---++ Project constraints:

   **Prof Gurevych's ideas for the project*
   * Enhancing information present in raw text with information from a knowledge base and apply reasoning techniques to solve a task
   * For this purpose the following problems must be solved:
      * Transforming a text into a logical forms (possibly represented by embeddings)
      * Grounding of the derived logical forms in a knowledge base: entity linking, relation matching
      * Joint inference: Reasoning over the information from the knowledge base and the text
