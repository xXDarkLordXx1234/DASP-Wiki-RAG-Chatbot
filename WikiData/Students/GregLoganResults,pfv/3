---+ Experiment Results

Initial experiments on environment-part-2 data looked good until I factored in the false positives:

22 Questions, 11 Opinionated, 9 Detected, 8 False Positives.

Questions are classed as opinionated by my code on one of three conditions:
   * The question has more than X number of words in the dictionary list
   * The question has more than Y sentences, and has at least Z opinion words
   * The question has only one sentence and has more than one opinion word

Other datasets are still in progress. Dictionary attached at [[%ATTACHURL%/opinionwords.txt][opinionwords.txt]]

[DB]: Have you split the dataset into a development set and a test set?

[DB]: Have you tried opinionated phrases like "what is the best" in addition to opinion words?
