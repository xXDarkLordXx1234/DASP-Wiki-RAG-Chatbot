Common misconception: Anarchy as Anomi
Common misconception: Anarchy as Anomie The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder -- what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order) -- is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions; they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any

Debates such as this one, they feel, are a waste of time. Anarchies functioning today We define as anarchies the communities that operate using de facto anarchist law which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion via media such as publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function
On the debate of capitalism versus socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making their own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

Punishment type however should be changed, since for example sending an autistic to the library or room as 'punishment' often acts like a reward; and a nice picnic as a reward might act as a punishment if it goes against obsession with predictability of routine(strong autistic trait), if wind/double meaning overload/sunlight/eye contact inconfort forces the autistic to 'space out', or if the picnic is associated with a reward for say some great school success but there will not be a picnic for the next identical great school success(another aspect of obsession with predictability - easily avoided by making rewards and punishment very predictable well in advance)

According to the National Climatic Data Center's GHCN 2 data, which is composed of 30-year smoothed climatic means for thousands of weather stations across the world, the college weather station at Fairbanks, Alaska, is about 3 C (5 F) warmer than the airport at Fairbanks, partly because of drainage patterns but also largely because of the lower albedo at the college resulting from a higher concentration of pine trees and therefore less open snowy ground to reflect the heat back into space
