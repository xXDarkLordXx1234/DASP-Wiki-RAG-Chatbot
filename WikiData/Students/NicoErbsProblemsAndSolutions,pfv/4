---++++ TreeTaggerPosLemma is raising an exception during initilization that i cannot open location file:resource/TreeTagger_3.1
In the xml descriptor of this annotator there is a requirement bundle with a fixed location. Change the location to the correct location.
   
---++++ Problems with UIMA datapath
Create a file .datapath and set datapath in the program
   
---++++ AE leads to undeterministic behaviour
Use type priorities like first lemma and then sentence (Descriptor --&gt; Indexes)
   
---++++ When creating a aggregate analysis engine it returns an error if ae from other projects should be applied
Use CPE instead of aggreagte AE
   
---++++ xml cannot be opened with Component Descriptor Editor in eclipse
Right click on project --&gt; Properties --&gt; UIMA --&gt; and paste path of project.
