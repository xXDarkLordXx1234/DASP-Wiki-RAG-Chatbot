---++++ *xx.xx.xxxx - xx.xx.xxxx*

---++++ Meeting *2.7.2021*
   * multitask learning setup (German BERT) 
      * use German conll 2014 as aux task (todo)
   * XLM-Roberta with 
      * multitask learning (done)
      * paraphrasing by backtranslation -> currently developing, minimal improvements with chinese and russian
   * MTL for !BiLSTM
   * Sentence sequence tagging -> for new texprax data?

---++++ Meeting *11.06.2021*
   * multitask learning setup (German BERT) 
      * use German conll 2014 as aux task (todo)
      * + industrie and zerspanung respectively (done)
   * XLM-Roberta with 
      * multitask learning (done)
      * cross-lingual multitask learning using translated data (todo)
   * paraphrasing by backtranslation

---++++ Meeting *28.05.2021*
   * multitask learning setup (German BERT and !BiLSTM):
      * use German conll 2014 as aux task
      * + industrie and zerspanung respectively 
   * paraphrasing by backtranslation
   * XLM-Roberta with
      * multitask learning
      * crosss-lingual multitask learning using translated data

---++++ Meeting *21.05.2021*
   * presentation feedback
   * use the new data
   * multitask learning setup (German BERT and !BiLSTM):
      * use German conll 2014 as aux task
      * + industrie and zerspanung respectively 
   * paraphrasing by backtranslation
   * XLM-Roberta with
      * multitask learning
      * crosss-lingual multitask learning using translated data

---++++ Meeting *07.05.2021*
   * focus on question and answer identification
   * slides/literature research by Wednesday/Thursday

---++++ Meeting *30.04.2021*
   * literature review on German NER -> some progress : new !GermanBERT [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.10906.pdf][version]]
   * !GermanBERT -> first results -> 0.7 accuracy? 
   * Logistic regression -> 0.9 accuracy on training data -> probably only 'O' token prediction
   * !BiLSTM + Wordembeddings (still pending)
   * tbd: switching to macro f1 scores

---++++ Meeting *23.04.2021*
   * literature review on German NER
   * !GermanBERT
   * !BiLSTM + Wordembeddings

---++++ Meeting *09.04.2021*
   * next steps:
      * training pipeline

---++++ Meeting *12.03.2021*
   * Baselines:
      * Wordembeddings: Logistic regression, !BiLSTM
      * Bert-esk models
   * should be done by mid April

---++++ Meeting *19.02.2021*
