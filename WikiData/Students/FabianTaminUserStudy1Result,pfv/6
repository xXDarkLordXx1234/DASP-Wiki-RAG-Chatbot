      * Content frame.
      * Sidebar frame.
      * Tag frame.
      * Keywords frame.
   * Content Frame & Menu
      * Menu should not show too many items simultaneously. Only items must used items should there. Further navigation, like extra submenu item is necessary to implement many features.
      * Menu attracts user&#8217;s focus too much. The important parts are actually the contents. Menu should have softer look.
      * Most participants want to see several types of main information (information in main frame) simultaneously. A user likes to see just one type of main information at certain time.
      * *Recommended items*: summary, table of contents, images.
      * *UI-implementation*: _tab_.
   * Sidebar
      * Sidebar is a nice feature. One can see many kinds of extra information simultaneously. 
      * Keeping sidebar small.
      * Implementation of scrollers for each sidebar.
      * Hide and more toggle is jumpy.
      * *Recommended items*: related links (links used by current article and backlinks), external links, sniffed articles.
      * *UI-implementation*: _accordion_.
   * Window
      * Article name in window can be mixed with heading in main frame for simplicity.
      * Icons for window controllers. Help icon should not attract user's attention too much.
      * Scroller
         * Some participants like it with scroller, some suggest about automatic resizing window
      * Frame lines are distracting to one participant.
   * Detail-meter
      * For some participants it is not necessary or anyhow too much. Think about toggle &#8220;more&#8221;. One participant likes multi-iterations of toggle more.
      * Adding sentences among read sentences could be distracting.
      * It is better to think about this feature after or while implementing summary feature.
---+++ Features
   * Summary
      * Summary is the most important thing for every participant.
      * One participant likes to use 1st paragraph as a part of summary. He thinks that it would be too bad if it were not there.
