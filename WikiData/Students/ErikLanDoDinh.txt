---++ Thesis: Automatic Identification of Novel Metaphorical Expressions

---+++ How to use !IdentifyMetaphors.groovy

Short instructions on how to use !IdentifyMetaphors.groovy (attached). Make sure a groovy is installed correctly first.

Usage: !IdentifyMetaphors.groovy resources-directory input-directory output-directory output-format [topK] [features...]

Example: !IdentifyMetaphors.groovy D:\ukp\diplom\standalone\resources D:\ukp\diplom\standalone\input D:\ukp\diplom\standalone\output docx

In the standard configuration, the script only reads DOCX files.

Mandatory resources:
   * Lucene index containing lemmas and the documents they are contained in
      * e.g. extracted from deWaC (de.wangtang.diplom.preparation.DewacToLucene; you may have to change paths)
      * put it in resources/lucene

Optional resources:
   * To use selectional preferences:
      * a mysql table containing selectional preferences (table structure in attached structure.sql)
      * relative counts for nouns and verbs: _NOUN_-relative.txt and _VERB_-relative.txt in resources
      * one way to create the selpref repositories and the relative count files is using !BuildNounSelPrefRepo.java and !BuildVerbSelPrefRepo.java (included in de.wangtang.diplom.preparation), although you may have to change paths there 	
      * a UBY installation (with GermaNet)
      * a mysqlLogin.properties (attached) containing the mysql server, database and login information
      * Google Books 3-grams German (http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html) in resources/google_books_ngrams
   * To use the novelty filter:
      * Google Books 1-gram file (googlebooks-ger-all-totalcounts-20120701.txt, from the above URL) in resources/google_books_ngrams
      * a file "year_published.txt" in the input documents directory, containing the years each document was published in (format: year TAB filename)

Short notes on ongoing work:

---++++ 01.05.2013
   * Finished creating repository of selectional preferences for the input documents
   * Also extracted nouns and deduced label counts from GBN + UBY
   * Created different vectors, running experiments
   * Reading, Writing

---++++ 15.01.2013
   * After failed attempts using lucene, berkeleydb and some other candidates, Google Books Ngrams access is now done via piecewise recompressed files in combination with index files (roughly as in http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fcds.2012.37.issue-4/v10209-011-0015-8/v10209-011-0015-8.xml) 
   * Normalized Google Distance with Dewac, type->document lists in Lucene
   * Discovered problem in GMM when using high-dimensonal vectors; floating point precision problems, matrices tend to get singular
   * Started work on CSniper metaphor integration (separate project from trunk)
   * Extended DocxReader

---++++ 13.12.2012 - 19.12.2012
   * Refactoring
   * Test Pipeline for evaluation of labeled Metaphors (atm not Lab-based)
   * Normalized Google Distance as similarity measure, which uses web1t 5-gram as corpus (untested -&gt; need web1t)
   * Different approaches to efficiently reading Google Books Ngrams: directly from the .gz files (slow), from a lucene index (building takes ages, querying faster than .gz, but maybe not enough), currently trying BerkeleyDB
   * Organisation: Finished short mathematical abstract for Prof. Kohler (see attachment)
