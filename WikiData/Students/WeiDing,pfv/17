   * To do:
      * create a new featureType for subject and object, including the text-mention selection and the dropdown to KB concept. The mention should also link to another layer storing the entity of mention. Consider !LinkWithRoleModel is used to select text span. !LinkFeatureEditor (!AnnotationActionHandler getEditorCas() could read Jcas)
      * configure in !ProjectInitializer
      * a draft for mid-term presentation
