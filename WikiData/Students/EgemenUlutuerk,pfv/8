---+!! Bachelor Thesis: Feature Optimization in Multimodal Emotion Detection Models
*Start date:* 15.12.2021

*Supervisor:* Tobias Mayer

---++ Meeting 08.02.2022
   * implementing new version of visual extractor (editing parts of the wrapper for pipeline convenience)
   * comparing batchsizes (between averaging and 1 to 4 picked frames per video)
      * averaging better solution

---++ Meeting 02.02.2022
   * testing with feature selectors
   * further fixing feature formatting

   * QUESTION how to handle different modules. Concatinate first then select or select before concatinating
      * AFTER MEETING: for now select before merging 
   * PROBLEM video selection has performance issues (is frame skipping ok or not?)
      * AFTER MEETING: using frame averaging

---++ Meeting 21.01.2022
   * determining gridsearch time on "krusty" node (ca 2:30 hours)
   * found approximate issue of memory issue (limiting grid_search to 36-40 iteration on 32GB RAM)
   * TODO fixing preprocess pipeline

---++ Meeting 11.01.2022
   * determining hyperparameters for further research
   * comparing accuracy using determined hyperparamters and custom feature set

---++ Meeting 04.01.2022
   * fixed grid_search function on slurm and updated dependecies
   * implemented script_generator to split bigger grid_searches into smaller searches
   * ran grid_search
   * created (temporary) feature list

---++ Meeting 15.12.2021
   * slurm tutorial machen
   * baselines lauff√§hig machen
