---+!! Bachelor Thesis: Feature Optimization in Multimodal Emotion Detection Models
*Start date:* 15.12.2021

*Supervisor:* Tobias Mayer

---++ Meeting 23.03.2022
   * fixed data evaluation
      * application I used did not read the data correctly (changing the order of the columns)
   * Preparing midterm presentation
   * Ideas:
      * Integrated Gradient
      * single baselines
      * cnn approach for data

---++ Meeting 16.03.2022
   * chi2, recursive, treebased selection tested on qmn (runtime around one hour)
   * Frage: interpretability, feature-importance, feature-attribution with captum possible
      * https://github.com/pytorch/captum (feature importance calculation with captum)
      * "Captum is currently in beta and under active development!"
      * Integrated Gradients calculation already working
      * Supposed to be compatible with Multimodality (although not yet sure how)

---++ Meeting 09.03.2022
   * last weeks issue solved (selecting worsened the accuracy with used parameters)
      * extratree -> ca 21%
      * more tests this week (with different parameters and chi2 + recursive selector) 

---++ Meeting 04.03.2022
   * issues when trying to select with tree, recursive the chi2 selector (dataset containing NaN value)
      * CURRENT_SOLUTION: replacing NaN with zeroes (better solution?)
      * tree selection => could not finish (loss value overflow)
         * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68450374/loss-value-and-val-loss-value-not-decreasing-in-rnn-algorithm-for-continuous-dat
           i will try different lr in single runs instead of grid_search to see if that fixes the issue
      * Next step for weekend: preparing midterm presentation and extract features with tweaks in the preprocessing over weekend

---++ Meeting 23.02.2022
   * Scaling and Variance-Threshold selection with different thresholds on qmnn => ca 24%
   * qmnn issue high vram usage

---++ Meeting 16.02.2022
   * added reproducability
      * hyperparameter selection
      * getting list of removed features
   * fixed selection pipeline
   * ((  first indication: scaling iemocap on icon between 0 and 1 -> better accuracy and higher f1, low samplesize on       
     hyperparameters for testing purposes  ))

---++ Meeting 08.02.2022
   * implementing new version of visual extractor (editing parts of the wrapper for pipeline convenience)
   * comparing batchsizes (between averaging and 1 to 4 picked frames per video)
      * averaging better solution

---++ Meeting 02.02.2022
   * testing with feature selectors
   * further fixing feature formatting

   * QUESTION how to handle different modules. Concatinate first then select or select before concatinating
      * AFTER MEETING: for now select before merging 
   * PROBLEM video selection has performance issues (is frame skipping ok or not?)
      * AFTER MEETING: using frame averaging

---++ Meeting 21.01.2022
   * determining gridsearch time on "bob" node (ca 2:30 hours)
   * found approximate issue of memory issue (limiting grid_search to 36-40 iteration on 32GB RAM)
   * TODO fixing preprocess pipeline

---++ Meeting 11.01.2022
   * determining hyperparameters for further research
   * comparing accuracy using determined hyperparamters and custom feature set

---++ Meeting 04.01.2022
   * fixed grid_search function on slurm and updated dependecies
   * implemented script_generator to split bigger grid_searches into smaller searches
   * ran grid_search
   * created (temporary) feature list

---++ Meeting 15.12.2021
   * slurm tutorial machen
   * baselines lauff√§hig machen
