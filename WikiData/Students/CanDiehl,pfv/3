---++ 2016-04-05 (open) Questions & Answers
   * What are arguments in the context of this thesis?
   * What are potential data sources?
      * Question in that context: How does the ideal data look like?
      1 Query Web search engine (e.g. faroo) per API or manually (potential violation of ToS) and save top n results
         * Maybe use more than 1 query to get results on a subject (e.g. 1 for pro, one for con)
      2 <del>Existing corpora with debate data (Probably difficult to find a fitting German corpus)</del>
   * What are possible methods for evaluating?
      * User Study:
         * Users evaluate result on subjects according to relevance and correct side (pro/con) via web interface
            * Potential problem -> completeness of the collected information not guaranteed, how could this be evaluated?
   * Could document type/name and metadata help improve the Pro/Con Detection?
      * Most documents state in their title, if they argue for or against the subject or both
      * This could potentially be exploited in combination with html-metadata to easier identify Pro/Con statements
   * How to detect indirect references to the subject?
      * Research State of the Art, good solutions should be available

      * Aggregation of arguments (what are arguments in the context of this thesis?)
      * Potential data sources (English or German or both)
      * "Search engine" that summarizes/aggregates argumentation relevant propositions structured as pro and con.
      * Evaluation?
