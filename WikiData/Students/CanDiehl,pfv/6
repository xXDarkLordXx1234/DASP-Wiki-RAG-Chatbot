   * SVN for students?
      * Yes, but I have no access (https://scruffy.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/svn/dkpro_students)
   * Status Update:
      * Java Web Search implemented 
         * Currently using Google Custom Search (100 queries per day)
         * Hint:
            * Cache results of (each) step(s) on file system (use Hash as key for storage (maybe include classname as well))
            * Use for each step a clear defined interface (in order to exchange the modules)
            * Parameters: number hits, language (de/en)
   * Next Steps:
      * Implement general architecture (define interfaces, data flow, caching, etc. and implement it)
      * Implement Proposition Extraction
      * Research Clustering Literature

---++ 2016-04-06 (open) Questions & Answers
   * Discuss current state of task description
   * What are arguments in the context of this thesis?
      * Actually, it is not clear if the extracted propositions are "arguments", they could be "argument components" with unknown type or just "propositions/statements" on the queried subject.
   * What are potential data sources?
      * Question in that context: How does the ideal data look like?
      1 Query Web search engine (e.g. faroo) per API or manually (potential violation of ToS) and save top n results
         * Maybe use more than 1 query to get results on a subject (e.g. 1 for pro, one for con)
      2 <del>Existing corpora with debate data (Probably difficult to find a fitting German corpus)</del>
   * What are possible methods for evaluating?
      * User Study:
         * Users evaluate result on subjects according to relevance and correct side (pro/con) via web interface
            * <del>Potential problem -> completeness of the collected information not guaranteed, how could this be evaluated?</del>
         * Use automatically extracted pro con lists for several subjects and ask participants e.g. if polarity of items is correct, if clusters are redundant, if items are meaningful, etc.
         * Evaluate results using IAA scores and conduct error analysis
         * evaluation strategy similar to Levy, Ran, Yonatan Bilu, Daniel Hershcovich, Ehud Aharoni, and Noam Slonim. 2014. Con-text dependent claim detection. In Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2014), pages 1489Â–1500, Dublin, Ireland.
   * Could document type/name and metadata help improve the Pro/Con Detection?
      * Most documents state in their title, if they argue for or against the subject or both
      * This could potentially be exploited in combination with html-metadata to easier identify Pro/Con statements
   * How to detect indirect references to the subject?
      * Research State of the Art, good solutions should be available
      * This task is called co-reference resolution 
   * Proposition extraction: http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~stanovg/propextraction.html
   * Clustering
      * How important is domain knowledge or similarity measures?
      * We might need Semantic Similarity (DKPro Similarity)
      * Research clustering of short documents (single sentences / microblogs / twitter)

   * Discussed Workflow of the thesis and signed contract(s)
   * Clarified expectations and requirements
   * Started elaborating the topic
      * Aggregation of arguments (what are arguments in the context of this thesis?)
      * Potential data sources (English or German or both)
      * "Search engine" that summarizes/aggregates argumentation relevant propositions structured as pro and con.
      * Evaluation?
