Hierarchical Clustering:

+ Easy to Rank		- Very Slow
+ Easy to find a label		- Hierarchy must be resolved into clusters
+ No Fixed Cluster Size needed

Centroid-based Clustering:

+ Label are naturaly created	- Fixed Cluster Size Needed
+ Faster than HC		- Good Seeds should be assured
+ Efficient with good seeds	- Ranking need to be implemented


Density-based clustering:

+ Can be much faster		- Parameter Sensitive
+ No Fixed Cluster Size needed	- Ranking need to be implemented
+ Arbitary shaped solutions	- Need Strategy to find a label (no direct center)
+ Ignores outliers
