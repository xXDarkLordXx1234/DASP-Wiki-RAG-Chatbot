"Some of the "equivalent" phrasing was an exact copy of the text."

"an answer 'I don't know' / 'Neither nor' would be quite helpful at some points.  

For the 'equivalent' / 'not equivalent' questions: I found the distinction quite hard for the first statements of 'Mindestlohn'. E.g. what if the sentence is basically the same, but provide some more facts, e.g. not only that the Mindestlohn is introduced, but that it will be 8,50 Euro. For such examples I was confused if those statements are equivalent or not. The problem was also, that the presented statements were not arguments (in my point of view) but simply facts. And some facts provided more information than other, but were basically the same."
