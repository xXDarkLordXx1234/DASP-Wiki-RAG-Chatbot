also cloning may give the opportunity 
cloning may be the only way 
will cloning thus compromise a child s identity 
the successful cloning of household pets holds special significance 
cloning of farm animals is legal 
cloning is a naturally occurring phenomenon 
cloning raises several serious questions

similarly cloning will also severely affect diversity 
cloning can also provide a viable solution 
human cloning is a blunt form of copies 
cloning is a reproductive right 
reproductive cloning could allow parents of a child 
reproductive cloning would allow lesbians 
reproductive cloning can provide genetically related children 
cloning is a form of asexual reproduction 
reproductive cloning is inherently unsafe 
reproductive cloning would diminish the sense of uniqueness of an individual 
reproductive cloning would foster an understanding of children 
thirdly research cloning is more morally objectionable 
i will make further arguments 
cloning has opened many doors 
the cloning of human embryos is illegal 
cloning plants the technology 
therapeutic cloning involves cloning cells 
i discussed types of human cloning 
human cloning is illegal 
cloning could produced individuals 
cloning is way 
cloning could be only way 
cloning has flip side too 
cloning finds applications 
i would make the following changes 
i also drew a visual diagram 
also i was able 
reproductive cloning turn human embryos 
human cloning represents the very worst characteristics of capitalism 
cloning is very costly 
reproductive cloning the very policy 
therapeutic cloning is therefore no different 
therapeutic cloning covers an array of scientific possibilities 
cloning takes place 
reproductive cloning places an altered human 
reproductive cloning are clearly different 
human cloning is basically 
actually cloning is a phenomenon 
cloning is actually cloned 
cloning is the creation of an exact genetic copy of any organism 
cloning is hard enough 
reproductive cloning poses other risks 
cloning would allow these very 
research cloning would allow new tissues perhaps even 
reproductive cloning allows reproduction 
cloning opens a whole new realm of biological science 
therapeutic cloning is more 
reproductive cloning has the intent 
cloning will change the human perspective 
cloning does not simply affect the few donors 
cloning of cows has the same potential 
can cloning potentially hurt the texas longhorn breed 
i have followed the developments 
i am a texas longhorn breeder 
i study the effects 
cloning is equal 
therapeutic cloning provides the opportunity 
medical cloning offers the chance 
cloning is a very attractive proposition 
cloning allows its 
cloning is production of genetic duplicates 
cloning provides more supply of plants 
the cloning of cattle can produce animals 
the cloning of certain animals may bring advantages 
human cloning creates questions 
i have included general interest comments 
cloning presents social consequences 
cloning is comparable 
cloning would bypass mendelism 
cloning provides the potential 
cloning will create an uncastrated cat 
cloning increases the number of generations 
cloning may be the most advanced aspect of reproductive technology 
the cloning of the deceased pet might deny a home 
cloning is resurrection of genetic content 
cloning potentially gives the ability 
cloning will never be an efficient form of reproduction 
cloning hit global headlines 
human cloning produces individuals artificially 
human cloning produces 
human cloning violates the rights of the child 
cloning would allow a child 
cloning represents a fundamental shift 
moreover reproductive cloning will allow lesbian couples 
human cloning turns the parent 
cloning treats children 
reproductive cloning harms the integrity of the family 
cloning still requires mothers 
however human cloning is a completely artificial form of reproduction 
reproductive cloning undermines human dignity 
will human cloning reduce genetic diversity 
however therapeutic cloning is a matter 
cloning involves the use of advanced reproductive technology precisely 
human cloning plays god less 
is human cloning compromises human dignity 
does cloning undermine individualism 
therapeutic cloning is most rewarding 
therapeutic cloning is not just a remedy also 
therapeutic cloning is independent of wait times 
therapeutic cloning is thus safe 
therapeutic cloning is a process 
cloning can reached even greater heights 
unfortunately i have not seen a holistic explanation of both sides 
basically human cloning is the artificial process 
i judge this purpose 
therapeutic cloning is indeed a very sensitive subject especially 
therapeutic cloning definitely has a slippery slope argument 
therapeutic cloning would provide the opportunity 
additionally cloning creates a lack of genetic diversity 
the cloning also results many miscarriages 
animal cloning has several benefits 
animal cloning is quite real 
cloning is the process of reproducing organisms

human cloning would have a disastrous effect 
human cloning would divert resources 
human cloning would lessen the worth of individuals 
human cloning would produce psychological distress 
no human cloning should ever take place 
human cloning might make possible important advances 
thus human cloning could never replicate individuals

reproductive cloning could speed the aging process 
human cloning can limit the variation

reproductive cloning can increase the chance of medical malpractice 
reproductive cloning allows faster recovery 
reproductive cloning can give a new meaning 
then human cloning would be the next best thing 
more importantly reproductive cloning creates copied cells of an individual 
human cloning is the technology 
would cloning eliminate a gene 
i completely see the potentially benefits 
cloning reduces genetic variation 
cloning might actually be a good thing 
i need point 
human cloning is one of those times 
i am dead 
i am doing a report 
cloning can bring end 
cloning is the future
