---++ Schedule

---+++++ Week 1 - 2
   * Research in text segmentation (ts). Implement prototypical segmentation targeting optimal coherence and size for keyword extraction.
   * Research in keyword extraction (ke). Implement prototypical keyword extraction with index entry semantics.
   * Combine of ts and ke in pipeline, conceptual evaluation.
   * Sketch conceptual overview of different segmentation and keyword algorithms in thesis. 
      * What exists? What is implemented in DKPro?

---+++++ Week 3 - 4
