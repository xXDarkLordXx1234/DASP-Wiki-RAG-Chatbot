---+++ SemEvalSegmentation

%TOC%

---++++ Possible approaches for segmentation
   * After a fixed amount of sentences.
   * When one or two linebreaks appear
   * JTextTile (exisiting component in DKPro)

---++++ Possible approaches for recombining keyphrases from different segments
A keyphrase annotation consists of its String representation and its score. The score can be changed to integrate a weight in some way. Different weights can be used:
   * A keyphrase is rated higher if it appears in more segments
   * A keyphrase is rated higher, the earlier it appears in a segment (only makes sense with some Segmenters)
   * A keyphrase is rated higher, the earlier the segment of the keyphrase appears
