---++ Weekly Activity Reports

---+++ Week 21 from 23.05.2022 to 27.05.2022
   * Read the background research inclusive papers related to the topic
   * Got access to Slurm 
      * Set up the virtual environment with the needed libraries
   * Learned transformers
      * Followed tutorials that may be helpful for the thesis
      * Read about possible methods that will/can be used
---+++ Week 22 from 28.05.2022 to 03.06.2022
   * Got a closer look at the methodologies and the models that will be used (T5, Bert)
   * Cloned the first model that will be used:
      * made some changes to make it work 
      * trained the model 
---+++ Week 23 from 06.06.2022 to 10.06.2022
   * Ran the model on some random datasets and analyzed the results
   * Created another cuda environment because I installed the wrong pytorch 
---+++ Week 24 from 13.06.2022 to 17.06.2022
   * Pre-processed the data of MetaQA1.0 to fit into the input of the Question-Converter model
   * Ran the model on some of the agents with their respective datasets 
---+++ Week 20 from 24.06.2022 to 17.06.2022
   * Created a fine-tuned Bert Model which will be responsible for the main task: NLI
---+++ Week 27 from 01.07.2022 to 01.06.2022
   * Tested the model with one agent and 7 datasets
   * Analysed the results
---+++ Week 04 from 01.07.2022 to 08.06.2022
