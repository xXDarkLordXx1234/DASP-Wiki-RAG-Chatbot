---++ Weekly Activity Reports

---+++ Week 21 from 23.05.2022 to 27.05.2022
   * Read the background research inclusive papers related to the topic
   * Got access to Slurm 
      * Set up the virtual environment with the needed libraries
   * Learned transformers
      * Followed tutorials that may be helpful for the thesis
      * Read about possible methods that will/can be used
---+++ Week 22 from 28.05.2022 to 03.06.2022
   * Got a closer look at the methodologies and the models that will be used (T5, Bert)
   * Cloned the first model that will be used:
      * made some changes to make it work 
      * trained the model 
---+++ Week 23 from 06.06.2022 to 10.06.2022
   * Ran the model on some random datasets and analyzed the results
   * Created another cuda environment because I installed the wrong pytorch 
---+++ Week 24 from 13.06.2022 to 17.06.2022
   * Pre-processed the data of MetaQA1.0 to fit into the input of the Question-Converter model
   * Ran the model on some of the agents with their respective datasets 
---+++ Week 25 from 20.06.2022 to 24.06.2022
   * Created a fine-tuned Bert Model which will be responsible for the main task: NLI
---+++ Week 26 from 27.06.2022 to 01.07.2022
   * Tested the model with one agent and 7 datasets
   * Analysed the results
---+++ Week 27 from 04.07.2022 to 08.07.2022
   * Written the introduction and started with the related work.  
---+++ Week 28 from 11.07.2022 to 15.07.2022
   * Code refactoring
   * Wrote ideas about related work 
---+++ Week 29 from 18.07.2022 to 23.07.2022
   * The results were not as expected => tried with other parameters
   * Used Neptune to track experiments and register different variants of the model
---+++ Week 30 from 25.07.2022 to 29.07.2022
   * Trained the model with different agents and datasets to look for possible solutions
---+++ Week 31 from 01.08.2022 to 05.08.2022
   * Did an upper bound evaluation to see what the model is capable of in the best case possible
   * => good results so the model is worth implementing
   * Rewrote the model's code with training steps to debug the code
---+++ Week 32 from 08.08.2022 to 12.08.2022
   * Prepared the slides for the mid-term presentation
   * Wrote the results and some future improvements
---+++ Week 33 from 15.08.2022 to 19.08.2022
