---++ AKA Semantic Relatedness.

So far I've found several ways to measure this

   * Based on WordNet - (A. Budanitsky) - Calculates paths between words in WordNet. 
   * Pair scaling with vectors - (R. Bayardo) - Similarity on search terms based on similarity of result vectors
   * Extended gloss overlap - (S.Banerjee) - WordNet - based approach. Shared words and glosses (definitions)
   * Clustering of Similar Words - (D.Lin) - Builds new thesauri based on large corpuses 
   * Word senses - (P.Panrel) - Word clustering
