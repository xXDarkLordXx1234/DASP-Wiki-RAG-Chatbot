Some questions about the entities to extract.

   * Extract table-of-content for *single page*. <br /> Does single page mean: the single article we are viewing?
   * Extract links *from and to single pages*. <br /> Does from and to single pages mean: the article links in the current article and the articles, which have links to current article?
   * Extract *tags* (if available). <br /> What kind of tags is it? Is that tag, which are already there in the article, or is that tag that we define by ourselves according to the article?
