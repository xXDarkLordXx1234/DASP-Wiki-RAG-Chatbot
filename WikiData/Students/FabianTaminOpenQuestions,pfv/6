---+ Open Question
---++ [DONE] Some questions about the entities to extract.

   * Extract table-of-content for *single page*. <br /> Does single page mean: the single article we are viewing?
      * Page and article are the same in this case. (JH)
   * Extract links *from and to single pages*. <br /> Does from and to single pages mean: the article links in the current article and the articles, which have links to current article? (like caller & callee links)
      * Exactly! (JH)
   * Extract *tags* (if available). <br /> What kind of tags are they? Are they tags, which are already there in the article (e. g.: categories in wikipedia or wiktionary), or are they tags that we define by ourselves by extracting from the article?
      * Not every wiki has tags, MediaWiki has categories (which are often used as tags though). TWiki has a plug-in to add tags to articles. So, tags means the tags that are already present (JH)

---++ To Consider
   * Will imperfect information (Summarization and keyphrase extraction are not perfect) influence the users' decision on the worthiness of the information? Perhaps comparing "perfect" summaries and keyphrases with automatically extracted ones in the final user study might make sense, if we have the time.
