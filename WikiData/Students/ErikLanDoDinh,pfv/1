---++ Thesis: Automatic Identification of Novel Metaphorical Expressions

Short notes on ongoing work.
---++++ 13.12.2012 - 19.12.2012
   * Refactoring
   * Test Pipeline for evaluation of labeled Metaphors (atm not Lab-based)
   * Normalized Google Distance as similarity measure, which uses web1t 5-gram as corpus (untested -&gt; need web1t)
   * Different approaches to efficiently reading Google Books Ngrams: directly from the .gz files (slow), from a lucene index (building takes ages, querying faster than .gz, but maybe not enough), currently trying BerkeleyDB
   * Organisation: Finished short mathematical abstract for Prof. Kohler (see attachment)
