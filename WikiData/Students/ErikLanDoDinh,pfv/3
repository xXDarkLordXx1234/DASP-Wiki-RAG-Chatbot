---++ Thesis: Automatic Identification of Novel Metaphorical Expressions

Short notes on ongoing work.

---++++ 15.01.2013
   * After failed attempts using lucene, berkeleydb and some other candidates, Google Books Ngrams access is now done via piecewise recompressed files in combination with index files (roughly as in http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fcds.2012.37.issue-4/v10209-011-0015-8/v10209-011-0015-8.xml) 
   * Normalized Google Distance with Dewac, type->document lists in Lucene
   * Discovered problem in GMM when using high-dimensonal vectors; floating point precision problems, matrices tend to get singular
   * Started work on CSniper metaphor integration (separate project from trunk)
   * Extended DocxReader

---++++ 13.12.2012 - 19.12.2012
   * Refactoring
   * Test Pipeline for evaluation of labeled Metaphors (atm not Lab-based)
   * Normalized Google Distance as similarity measure, which uses web1t 5-gram as corpus (untested -&gt; need web1t)
   * Different approaches to efficiently reading Google Books Ngrams: directly from the .gz files (slow), from a lucene index (building takes ages, querying faster than .gz, but maybe not enough), currently trying BerkeleyDB
   * Organisation: Finished short mathematical abstract for Prof. Kohler (see attachment)
