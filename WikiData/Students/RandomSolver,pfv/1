---++ Random Solver Algorithm
---+++ Purpose

The random solver will be the bottom baseline for the real Wordnet algorithm. 
---+++ Implementation

1. Read the .csv file and create an array of OOO-Question objects

2. For each OOO-Question in the array run the solve() method 

2.1 The solve() method picks an answer at random and checks if the selected answer equals the correct answer

3. Count the matches with the correct answer

4. Check what percentage of the 104 questions has the algorithm solved correctly

5. For statistically better results run steps 1-4 100 times to get an aggregate percentage
---+++ Result

As expected the algorithm is correct in only 20% of the cases. This can be selected as a lower baseline.
