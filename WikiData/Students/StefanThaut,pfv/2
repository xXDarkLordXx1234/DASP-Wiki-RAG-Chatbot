---++ Week 21.10. - 27.10.:
   * Familiarization with the task
   * Review of literature on suitable corpora and BERT embeddings

---++ Week 28.10. - 03.11.:
   * Description of the corpora
   * First sections of the thesis about the corpora, their annotation schemes and related foundations
   * Introduction into concepts of Transfer Learning and recap of pytorch library

---++ Week 04.11. - 10.11.:
   * Preprocessing of the corpora -> summarization of their (separated) data into one CSV-File per corpus
   * Preprocessing of Lauschers gold labels into format for comparison with the output of Lauschers model prediction
   * Description of the evaluations of the particular corpora in their introducing paper
   * Locally setup of the Lauscher model
   * Implementation of the annotation tool for the annotation study and first version of the corresponding instructions

---++ Week 11.11. - 17.11.:
   * Reproduction of the scores of the Lauscher model
   * Error tracking regarding the Lauscher model and its experimental setup
   * Setup of the ARC model on Slurm
   * Preprocessing of Lauscher corpus for input into the ARC model
   * Revision of the instructions for the annotation study

---++ Week 18.11. - 24.11.:
   * Adjustment of the ARC model to the (preprocessed) Lauscher corpus
   * First experiments with the ARC model on the Lauscher corpus without finetuning and removal of the classification layer
   * Tests of the REST-API of the Lauscher model (for better reproduction of Lauscher scores)

---++ Week 25.11. - 01.12.:
   * Server problems on Slurm
   * Revision of the dataset for the annotation study and final version of its instructions
   * Revision of the splits of Lauscher corpus (now fully random) and reevaluation (per label as well as averaged) of Lauschers model on these (hopefully final) splits
   * First preliminary results of the annotation study
   * Gathering of possibilities of how to modify the ARC model for Transfer Learning and implementation of them

---++ Week 02.12. - 08.12.:
   * Bugfixing on Slurm
   * Deployment of the annotation study
   * Conversion of the other corpora into the ARC format and creation of respective splits
   * Preparation of the experiments of Transfer Learning with several configurations (with/out finetuning, various corpora, various splits, ...)
