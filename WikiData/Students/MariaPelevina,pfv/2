---++ 2015-11-11 Meeting Minutes
   * @discuss(CS): Working Group with two UKP colleagues. Both will contribute to the thesis.
      * Chinnappa Guggilla (Topic: Fact checking)
      * Tobias Falke (Topic: Structured Summaries)
   * @info(CS): There is another and more recent Semantic Parser which might be an alternative to the Bos parser: http://sivareddy.in/downloads
      * According to Mirella Lapata they will submit a TACL article by December 1st.
      * We will get a copy of the submission
      * Some notes from the correspondence with Lapata
         * 1. Siva will submit the dependency semantic parsing work to TACL (by December 1). Once we submits it, we can make the paper available to you, have a read see if it is useful at all.
         * 2. Then he will immediately start working on substituting the google dependency parser with a generic one. At the moment google has to parse sentences, send them the output, and so on. I believe he will spend some time making sure everything works as expected. This may take a month or so, I will be able to tell you more concretely once he starts working on it. Once we have a version, we can share it with you.
         * 3. He has made available his parser which takes NL as input and computes logical forms using CCG (similar to Bos): http://sivareddy.in/downloads (under GraphParser), you may want to use this until the dependency-to-LF parser is ready.
   * @info(CS): Another hint from Iryna which might be interesting: http://de.slideshare.net/markogrobelnik/from-texttoreasoning-markogrobelnikswank16apr2014
