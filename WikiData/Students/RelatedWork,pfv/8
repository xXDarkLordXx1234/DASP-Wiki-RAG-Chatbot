| 2000 | [[http://www.vldb.org/conf/2000/P527.pdf][Focused crawling using context graphs]] | 532 | 2 | Builds a graph of links directly and indirectly leading to target pages and learns to predict min. length to a target page for each link from language features of the link source. |
| 2000 | [[http://www.springerlink.com/content/r1723134248214t0/][Automating the Construction of Internet Portals with Machine Learning]] | 359 | 3 | Uses Naive Bayes on text surrouding a link to predict the discounted number of relevant future links; introduces two subsets of web to perform crawling on. Could also be relevant for clustering. |
| 2002 | [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=511466][Accelerated focused crawling through online relevance feedback]] | 229 | 3 | Uses a reinforcement-related approach, containing separate classifiers for following and storing links. Also makes explicit use of HTML structure. |
| 2004 | [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031117][Topical web crawlers: Evaluating adaptive algorithms]] | 172 | 2 | Discusses the major crawling approaches which surfaced until 2004 and provides an elaborate evaluation and comparision. |
| 2004 | [[http://www.springerlink.com/content/w3mrhf99xfw2umg7/][Focused Crawling Using Temporal Difference-Learning]] | 7 | 3 | Uses the same problem definition and supervised learning to predict action values, which makes it a direct competitor. The paper itself isn't very interesting, though. |
| 2007 | [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1243335][Combining text and link analysis for focused crawling-An application for vertical search engines]] | 61 | 3 | Uses a sample of relevant documents to train topic models using LSI to predict link relevance. |
| 2010 | [[http://www.springerlink.com/content/kk42758m8m321636/][Efficient Deep Web Crawling Using Reinforcement Learning]] | 5 | 2 | Makes use of reinforcement learning to find content which is only accessible through search queries. Could be helpful for extending the crawler with search capabilities (using Google to escape dead ends). |
| 2012 | [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2124328][Selecting actions for resource-bounded information extraction using reinforcement learning]] | 2 | 1 | Uses a very similar crawling approach to ours but mostly focuses on IE. Those features, however, could also work for us.  |

| *Year* | *Title* | *Citations* | *Relev.* | *Comments* |
| 2001 | [[http://www.springerlink.com/index/M20AV0YUMKMGETLA.pdf][Automatic Keyword Extraction Using Domain Knowledge]] | 51 | 1 | Uses simple term frequency values and features from a thesaurus. The latter is a good idea, but the system itself isn't very competitive. |
| 2003 | [[http://pdf.aminer.org/000/903/225/keyword_extraction_from_a_single_document_using_word_co_occurrence.pdf][Keyword Extraction from a Single Document using Word Co-occurrence Statistical Information]] | 260 | 2 | Uses co-occurence clustering and X² statistics to identify topic-biased terms. Performs slightly worse than tf*idf, but some of the ideas should be reused. |
| 2003 | [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1119383][Improved Automatic Keyword Extraction Given More Linguistic Knowledge]] | 203 | 3 | They use NP-chunker and POS tagger for candidate retrieval and then perform binary classification on only 4 features. Still a rather weak approach, but should be used as a baseline. |
| 2007 | [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1284916.1285164][Using Lexical Chains for Keyword Extraction]] | 75 | 3 | Computes lexical chains for the text and for each keyword candidate, it extracts features for the corresponding chains and the words role within them. Finally, supervised learning is used. |
| 2008 | [[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1613178][Graph-Based Keyword Extraction for Single-Document Summarization]] | 42 | 3 | They build co-occurance graphs and (a) use graph features for supervised learning and (b) use an unsupervised algorithm (HITS) to detect hubs. The latter seems interesting to derive features from. |
| 2009 | [[http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/P/P07/P07-1070.pdf][Towards an Iterative Reinforcement Approach for Simultaneous Document Summarization and Keyword Extraction]] | 63 | 3 | This is by far the most interesting approach and most serious competitor. Especially interesting is the notion of using summarization  information, such as sentence relevance, to model keyword importance from context. The approach essentially uses multiple graphs where nodes "reinforce" each other (so it's not actually reinforcement learning). |
