Since November 2008 I'm writing my master thesis <br />
*"Combining Answers from heterogeneous Web Documents for Question Answering"*.

<blockquote>
*Abstract:* Currently, the information of the World Wide Web is mainly accessed with
    search engines. Recent studies showed that the usual keyword-in-context
    lists are not always the best choice for presenting the results.
    Additionally, an increasing amount of people uses search engines,
    without knowing how to formulate good queries. This master thesis
    therefore describes the design and implementation of a question
    answering system that generates a summarized answer for open-domain
    natural language queries. The system aims to increase the quality of
    existing systems by using heterogeneous documents from Wikipedia, Yahoo!
    Answers and Frequently Asked Questions.

    Three main tasks have been identified: The first is passage extraction,
    which relies on semantic similarity and Hidden Markov Models for
    identifying irrelevant passages. Passage extraction obtains an average
    precision of 98% and recall of 81%. The second task calculates
    different clusterings for assigning a topic to each document. The best
    results have been found by combining k-means and Newman's community
    clustering, which results in an average clustering purity of 88%. The
    final step combines three different rankings and selects the top ranked
    sentences for composing the summary. Besides the textual summary that is
    particularly useful for answering definition questions, a list of
    frequent n-grams and URLs is created to support also factoid and list
    questions. While working with heterogeneous data, combining different
    approaches has been observed to be crucial for benefiting from the
    individual advantages and alleviate differences in format, length,
    style, focus, relevance as well as problems of ambiguity and redundancy
    within the documents.

    An evaluation of the resulting summaries has been done by comparing the
    system's ROUGE scores with the two systems MEAD and START.
    User-generated answers from ask.com and Answerbag are used as a
    reference corpus. The evaluation shows that the system obtains the
    highest F-measure scores and leads to overall useful summaries. A
    t-test showed that the system's ROUGE score improvements are
    significant.
