---++++ Task description
In this work a system for solving task #5 (Automatic Keyphrase Extraction from Scientific Articles) is the goal. To do so the existing experiments have to be adapted to the format of the training and test data.
Additionally the following steps can be done:
   * Use segmentation
   * Try supervised approaches

---++++ Data
Until now only trial data is available. It has the following characteristics:
   * One document in each file
   * A file containing a document ends with ".txt.final"
   * GoldStandard for all files are stored in one file only
   * Different GoldStandards (author, reader, combined) and (normal, stem)
   * GoldStandard is one document each line
   * Keywords seperated by comma

---++++ Evaluation
Evaluation can be done by a perl script (performance.pl). The script requires keywords in the same format as the GoldStandard.
Different options how to do that:
   * Create a reader which outputs keyphrase candidates in the corresponding format
   * Create perl script, which is transforming data to the correct format
