29.05.2020:
   * finished this week:
      * finished reading all relevant resources
      * research in regards to data procurement
            * current idea is to scrap data from https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/ similar to the data procurement in the paper "Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners"
            * difference is that we won't follow links, but take data directly from reddit (from the post's headline and content. comments may also include humor, but require too much filtering)
      * read PyTorch documentation and HuggingFace documentation
      * first commit in repository. includes
            * model class that will be extended by baseline model and the finetuned model later on.
            * class includes a predict method which can generate n candidates for the next word of a given text
      * set up riot client for communication
   * plans for next week:
      * continue working on baseline model
      * work on data procurement according to procedure explained above
      * get familiar with the ukp site and cluster
