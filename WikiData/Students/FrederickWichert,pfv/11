---+!! Bachelor Thesis: Utterance-level analysis of Psychotherapy Dialogues using Hierarchical Dialogue Modeling Approaches
*Start date:* 02.01.2023

*End date:* TBA

*Supervisor:* Neha Warikoo, Tobias Mayer

---++ Meeting 10.05.2023
   * Continued writing on thesis
   * Prepared to share thesis to suerpvisor to get feedback

---++ Meeting 03.05.2023
   * Meeting was cancelled due to illness
   * Implemented Feedback on
   * Experiments for Knowledge Graphs are finished now

---++ Meeting 26.04.2023
   * Shared outline of paper to get feedback
   * Prepared Timeline for thesis in the reamining time
   * Experiments for Dialogue Modeling are finished now 

---++ Meeting 19.04.2023
   * started rerunning experiments with the original emotion labels
   * should be finished by next week   

---++ Meeting 12.04.2023
   * old emotions are now uploaded on SLURM Cluster
      * now I can compare the performance on the old emotions compared to the newer emotions
      * if that makes a difference, unfortunately the performance gain was because of the new labels, not because of English models

---++ Meeting 06.04.2023
   * Meeting got moves to Thursday
   * The old Emotion Categories are still not working, 

---++ Meeting 29.03.2023
   * Discussed Feedback from Presentation

---++ Midterm Presentation 24.03.2023
   * Future Experiments:
      * cross validation for different models
      * run models with higher epochs
      * 
   * Feedback:
      * Additional ER data:
         * Maybe include other ER training data with similar taxonomy
         * Maybe exchange classification layer after pre-training on different ER data
      * Context:
         * Does the context make sense?
         * Analyze context for length
         * Maybe filter out too long or too small utterances
         * Analyze results to see if length of context correlates to performance
         * Repeat BERT context analysis with dialogue focused models
         * Repeat BERT context analysis on IP
      * Translation:
         * Compare translation performance

---++ Meeting 22.03.2023
   * preparations for midterm presentation
   * feedback on slides and content so far

---++ Meeting 15.03.2023
   * Results for Emotion Recognition seem rather high
   * Can't join on original data because the ER files do not have session id
   * Discuss with Neha or Dana about these new ER labels

---++ Meeting 08.03.2023
   * Result table is halfway complete
   * Intent Labels seem to be missing in the translated file
   * Join on original data using session id and event id to uniquely identify utterance

---++ Meeting 01.03.2023
   * Discussed the exact structure of the BIU Translated file
   * It seemed like a couple of labels were missing, or different to the original
   * Emotion Labels are now constructed with the 

---++ Meeting 22.02.2023
   * Talked about Midterm presentation => Presentation will be on 24.03.2023
   * Talked about main evaluation table for thesis, see below (TODO: add table here)
   * Listed tasks to accomplish for midterm presentation
      * fill out evaluation table
      * start testing with curriculum learning
      * gather ideas for second half of the experimentation

---++ Meeting 15.02.2023
   * Explanation of the structure the BIU Dataset
   * Continued working on recreating the results from the paper
   * Sketched out evaluation table

---++ Meeting 08.02.2023
   * Setup of overleaf workspace for thesis. Start writing as early as possible
   * Repeating all the models and their tests on the SLURM cluster. The next step would be to adjust these for the BIU

---++ Meeting 01.02.2023
   * Questions about SLURM Cluster, basic setup of SLURM Cluster workplace

---++ Meeting 25.01.2023
   * UKP arrived that day. Talked about things to look into first from the wiki.

---++ Meeting 19.01.2023
   * Moved from originally Wednesday to Thursday.
   * Discussion about selected models for the thesis
      * TodBERT
      * ConvBERT
      * ConvBERT (DialoGLUE)
      * HRLCE
      * BERT

---++ Meeting 11.01.2023
   * Talked about the progress of the thesis. I started the outline of the thesis
