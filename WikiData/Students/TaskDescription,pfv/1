   1 Motivation Odd-one-out questions focus on the shared semantic properties of words. In order to solve the question, the entity that does not fit into a set with the other candidates has to be identified. This question type tests deep word knowledge and also the capabilities of analogical transfer. In various degrees of difficulty, these questions are used to assess the vocabulary skills of language learners and the general intellectual level of native speakers. The automatic generation of odd-one-out exercises can provide a good basis for adaptive testing environments. The determination of suitable candidate sets provides an interesting application area for semantic methods.
