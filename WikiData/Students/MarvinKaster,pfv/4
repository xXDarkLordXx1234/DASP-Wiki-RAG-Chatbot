---+!! Bachelor Thesis: Multilingual Contextual Probing
   * Deadline: 27 December 2019
   * Begin: 26 June 2019

---++ 09 September 2019 Meeting
   * Talked about the downstream results. The contextualized elmo performs only better on NER. No improvement on XNLI, DEP and POS
   * For the next meeting:
   * Check sentence length distribution of the treebank
   * Remove long sentences from the probing dataset
   * Fix that some words in Turkish (and probably Spanish, Russian) were separated in the probing task datasets
   * Prepare the repository for moving into the UKPLab repository (more comments and restructuring)
   * Add TagCount and CharacterBin to the probing tasks
   * Support bert
   * Read more literature about probing on bert and cross-lingual transfer
   * Update this wiki page

---++ 12 August - 08 September 2019
   * Finished the experiments on the downstream tasks for elmo
   * The contextualized elmo performs only better on NER. No improvement on XNLI, DEP and POS
   * Some reading (TODO Add literature here)
   

---++ 18-26 July 2019
   * Trained classifier for Downstream tasks (dep, xnli, ner, pos) for german, spanish, turkish and russian

---++ 17 July 2019: Meeting with Max and GÃ¶zde
   * Knowledgetransfer

---++ 10-17 July 2019

   * Trained classifier for fasttext, bpe, muse and elmo embeddings on Finnish, German, Spanish, Turkish and Russian
   * Collected results in a spreadsheet

---++ 10 July 2019 Meeting
   
---++ 27 June - 10 July 2019
   * Trained classsifiers for intrinsic probing tasks on german, finnish, spanish, russian and turkish

---++ 26 June 2019 Meeting
   

---++ 20-26 June 2019
   * Statistics about the sigmorphon19 dataset

---++ 19 June 2019 Meeting

---++ 13-19 June 2019
   * Wrote reader for the sigmorphon19 task 2 dataset and created probing dataset


---++ 12 June 2019 Meeting
