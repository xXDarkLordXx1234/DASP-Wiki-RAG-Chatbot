Deep Learning for extraction of predicate-argument structures

---++ CW14 3.4.2017 - 9.4.2017

   * No dependency context embeddings for German online
   * Found some German word embeddings already trained (word2vec, fasttext)
   * Got Access to Wiki
   * No access to data yet (?)
   * Translation-APIs like Google Cloud Translate or Yandex Translate are too expensive (15-20$ / 1 Mio characters)
   * Read the code of _basic_srl_system_, vague idea how it internally works
   
---+++ Next steps:

   * Evaluate German embeddings found online
   * Find out how to exactly evaluate word embeddings (some papers exist)
   * Understand data format of _basic_srl_system_
   * Maybe use FNWkde for first training of _basic_srl_system_

*Goal: Get basic_srl_system running*

---++ 6.4.2017 Kickoff meeting

   * Scheduled mid presentation to 11.7.2017
   * Get access to Wiki
   * basic_srl_system is now on Github
   * Clarify goal: only frame identification, if time maybe role id also

---+++ Fleshed out details for work package 1 (baseline)

   * Problem is projecting back annotations in translated text: German -translate-> English -FrameId-> Annotated English  -Project back-> Annotated German
   * Word-to-word translation at first
   * If time, use parse tree (syntax/dependency/...) and translate nodes
   * Look for translation tools (Babelnet, Google Translate, ...)

---+++ Things to solve

   * Get access to data
   * Look for translation tools
   * word embeddings for German text
