Current running experiment:<br />Put dependency parse tree into mysql. (10% finished, 5 days may be required)

Encounted problems:<br />Current major problem: Programs incapable to large amount of data.<br />      Problem and Mistakes:
   1   Third party programs can't deal with large amount of data. e.g. JWNL can't release memory of synset lookup. Standford parser is too slow for current application.<br />
   1 Didn't estimate the CPU, memory disk requirement in advance.
   1 Underestimate of overhead of implementing the methods in (Snow 2006)
   1 Third party library errors by dealing with certain data. e.g. Minipar consumes all memory when it encounters a sentence having words repeated several times.
   1 Have to fix the errors and find methods to handle uncovered details in the papers.
   1 Overcome the shortage of the third party library. e.g. Minipar can't deal with adverb and verb after punctuation properly.<br />
A comment on the report on 07.31:<br />The tree model is actually a byproduct of performance tunning.  All
optimization is actually motivated by improving performance and finding methods for the uncovered details in the papers. The
detailed description of the tree model may be misleading that I'm
focusing on optimization. The current focus is to develop the core system.<br />

Current coding status:<br />750K (91 classes, nearly no duplicate code) java source code and a small c++ program for putting parsing results into database. Over 40 Hours per week on development in the past 4 weeks.<br />
