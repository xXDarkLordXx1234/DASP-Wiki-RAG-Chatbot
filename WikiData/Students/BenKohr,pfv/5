---++ Things done (this week)

---++ Questions (this week)
   * There are some warning when I don't silence System.err in the Pipeline by DKPro. Maybe they aren't important, I'm not sure. What is your opinion?

   (log4j: WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.uima.resource.metadata.TypeSystemDescription).
   log4j: WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
   log4j: WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.

   * I don't have Outlook or something similar. In case the UKP meetings are each Tuesday, could you tell me the time and the place?
   * How to distinugish between agentive and non-agentive verbs?
   * How to distinguish between active and passive voice? I thought about using the POS tags, but I guess they don't give this information.
   * Please feel free to look over the current version (I guess this is better than informing you on Mondays, even if the version slightly changes afterwards), especially over the CoNLL Reader. I stepped through it (with the Debugging Tool) and tested it on the CONLL data and it seems working for me (except the todos, of course, see the two list items above), but maybe I understood something wrong or made a mistake...
