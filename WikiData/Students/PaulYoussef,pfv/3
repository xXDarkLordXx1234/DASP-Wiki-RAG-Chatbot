---+!! Bachelor thesis: Impact of activation functions on deep learning in NLP

*Start date*: 01.11.2017

*Supervisor*: Dr. Steffen Eger

---++ Current Status
   * *08.11.2017*:
      * Filled out application form [...]

---++ Meeting Minutes

   * For CNN: play around with different filter sizes, potentially other hyperparameters
      * can also play around with more optimizers if time permits: AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSprop
   * For CNN: adaptation of code is completely ok, if you have good reasons for doing so
   * Can also prepare RNN for Sequence Tagging Task: which implementation do you want to use?
      * TK in Tensorflow
      * NR in Keras
   * I gave you a potential structure of the thesis (>40 pages including everything)
      * For analysis: std is bad, mean is good
   * I also gave you feedback on the related work section
   * Maxout: k=4 (Optional k=2)

   * expirements on movie-reviews dataset are still running (maxout, leakyrelu, prelu are done)
   * I'm working on CNN and RNN for document classification and sequence tagging
   * I'm also working on the theory & background section in the thesis
