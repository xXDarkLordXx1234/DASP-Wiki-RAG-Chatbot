---+!! Bachelor thesis: Impact of activation functions on deep learning in NLP

*Start date*: 01.11.2017
*Supervisor*: Dr. Steffen Eger

---++ Current Status
   * *08.11.2017*:
      * Filled out application form [...]

   * For CNN: play around with different filter sizes, potentially other hyperparameters
      * can also play around with more optimizers if time permits: AdaGrad, AdaDelta, RMSprop
   * For CNN: adaptation of code is completely ok, if you have good reasons for doing so
   * Can also prepare RNN for Sequence Tagging Task: which implementation do you want to use?
      * TK in Tensorflow
      * NR in Keras
   * I gave you a potential structure of the thesis (>40 pages including everything)
      * For analysis: std is bad, mean is good
   * I also gave you feedback on the related work section
   * Maxout: k=4 (Optional k=2)
