   * @info(BH): I got 30 SR results of the recordings you already have, attached here -
      * [[%ATTACHURL%/20100619-SR-Results.zip][20100619-SR-Results.zip]]: 20100619-SR-Results.zip

Questions:
   * Why do we exactly compare Tf-Idf, BM-25 and Esa?
      * State of the art. Same thing with Lucene/Terrier. Task
   * Even mention topics I don't really use? (e.g. Recall)
      * Short, but yes.
   * How should I describe topics such as InvertedIndexConstruction? Problem: the question of the work is not how indexing works, but I can't just mention the word without any explanation.
      * Is InvertedIndexConstruction even needed? Often used, but not mandatory!
   * First discussing theory with some imaginary examples, then discussing the pipelines and architecture with real examples (crm)? I'm just not sure of that...
   * Esa Indexing takes too long and too much space. See [[ManuelWickLogbuch][Logbuch 17.06.2010]]
      * @question(BH): how long would it take to index all documents? how much space would it require

   * Solved problem to precompute ESA vectors
   * @info(BH): Terrier + ESA:

      * =weightingModel=ESA.class.getName();= 
      * =ComponentFactory.getSearcher(indexingEngine, aContext.getStorageLocation(DOCUMENT_INDEX_KEY,
						AccessMode.READONLY), weightingModel, weightingModelParameter,
						matchingModel, esaIndexPath)=
   * provide slides of upcoming presentation by next Friday
   * next steps: 
      * finalize Lucene and Terrier Retrieval
      * output results for manual inspection (relevant, not relevant)
      * store results in Trec format
      * integrate in ESA retrieval model
      * work on structure for thesis
---++!! 30th March 2010
   * Current status?
   * Next steps:
      * Perform retrieval with Lucene, Terrier
      * Use provided keywords lists
