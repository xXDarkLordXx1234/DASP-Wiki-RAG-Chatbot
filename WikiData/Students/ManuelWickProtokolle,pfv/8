---++21.06.2010
Questions:
   * Why do we exactly compare Tf-Idf, BM-25 and Esa?
   * Even mention topics I don't really use? (e.g. Recall)
   * How should I describe topics such as InvertedIndexConstruction? Problem: the question of the work is not how indexing works, but I can't just mention the word without any explanation.
   * First discussing theory with some imaginary examples, then discussing the pipelines and architecture with real examples (crm)? I'm just not sure of that...
   * Esa Indexing takes too long and too much space. See [[ManuelWickLogbuch][Logbuch 17.06.2010]]
