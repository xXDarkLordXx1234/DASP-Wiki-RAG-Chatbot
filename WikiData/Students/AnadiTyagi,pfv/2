---+!! Anadi Tyagi(Masters Thesis)

---++ Meeting (20/07/2017)
   * Obtaining meta data for freebase ids (the transE dataset) by using Wikidata sparql as a bridge to obtain the data
   * Develop a mechanism to formulate queries for images out of the meta data e.g. should we use labels and all aliases or part of the aliases? Does it help to use the type of the entity (e.g. human, city,...) in the query.
   * Crawl images based on the approach developed in the previous point and investigate them manually.
   * Studying the available solution for canonical image representation and think about own approach.

---++ Meeting (14/07/2017)
   * Setting up access to UKP
   * Preparing FB data for image crawling
