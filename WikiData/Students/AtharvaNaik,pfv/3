---+ *Internship Report*
<p align="center">
----+ TODO List
</p>

   * Setup VPN, Instant Messaging and SLURM
   * Papers to be read: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12417.pdf, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13912.pdf 
   * Read Validity chapter from book: Empirical Methods (Validity, Reliability and Significance) (Draft)
   * Try to come up with stastical tests for Validity measurs for classification, NLI or QA task (assuming Neural models instead of GAMs)

<p align="center">
-----+ Meeting Notes
10th August 2021: 
   * Discussion of idea about features that bias model prediction towards a certain class (similar to competency models paper, Trigger words from explainability tutorial slides) and maybe more generally the idea of Illegitimate features (information leakage) (as defined in the Empirical Methods book under the validity section)
   * Infrastructure/communications setup
   * One possible direction is Validity of features (circular features, bias features and information leakage)

-----+ Ideas and Thoughts
9th August - 15th August:

   *Bias Featues:* 
   *    These features (for most previous work) are based on normalized co-ocurrence statistics of features(like words) used by models and dataset categories. E.g. joint probability of features and labels normalized by feature probability or joint probability of features and labels normalized by feature and label proabability. 
   *    These metrics can't separate bias features necessary for a task and the ones that are spurious/misleading. 
   *    For a feature to be labeled as a bias feature it should not generalize to other domains/datasets of the same task.
   
   *Illegitimate Featues:*
   *    These features are a subset of bias features.
   *    These features are features that are so skewed with respect to the target label, that their presence alone is sufficient to predict the correct label.
   *    Ways to resolve, usually involve exploratory data analysis and testing on suitable out-of-sample data to compare expected peformance and observed performance.
   *    The issue is the difficult in making these out-of-sample datasets for each task.
