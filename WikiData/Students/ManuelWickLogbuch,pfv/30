   * ESA test crashed with JavaHeapSpace exception while merging the dictionaries at the end. But the basic terrier components work fine.
   * Started another run with 3200m heap space.
   * Discussed procedure of manual query generating. Tomorrow we will talk about final procedure.

---++28.06.2010
   * Comparison of terms in generated topics and given termlist.
   * [[%ATTACHURL%/termlist_analysis.txt][termlist_analysis.txt]]

---++23.06.2010
   * Benjamin gave me the new topics generated from the recordings (see [[ManuelWickProtokolle][Meeting Protokolle 22.06.2010]]).
   * The results for each recording can be found in this archive: [[%ATTACHURL%/recordingresults.zip][recordingresults.zip]]
<verbatim>
Mostly, the terms listed in the topics do not appear in the calls.
Example: (Live_96447913_2217174328_090714_090651_6)
Term: Erfassung, dargestellt, Verstand
Call is about a Genesis Word-AddIn. Later they also talk about Macros and a TerminalServer

In addition, the most terms doesn't make sense at all.

Sometimes there is only one term that doesn't match the topic.
Example: (Live_96447912_7251926142_090626_140748_6)
Term "Media"
The call is about an excel-list that cannot be opened

And sometimes the listed terms doesn't make any sense.
Example: (Live_96447915_22413060_090702_134615_0)
Terms: erreicht, verbunden, auswirkt
So, what's the topic? I could imagine that a article about "Telecommunication" is retrieved if you run a search with these terms. But it can be everything.

In a few cases there are terms that describe the topic indirectly. I'm just not certain it wasn't luck.
Example: (Live_96447915_7251926108_090710_092915_0)
Terms: Verträge (contracts)
The call is about a SQL-License. The customer wants to know when the key is send and they talk about a bill.

   * Meeting - Not unusual that an Esa-Index using Wikipedia is about 8-10mb per file.
   * Starting another Esa indexing run in StudentsLabs

   * Programming a little analyzer to get a better understanding of the CRM data (languages, contents, types, etc.)
   * First results: [[%ATTACHURL%/document_analysis.txt][document_analysis.txt]]

   * Stopped Esa-Indexing in StudentsLab after almost 3 days.  PC doesn't response at all.
   * Started Esa-Indexing @ home using 1/3 of all crm-files (about 17.000 files)
   * Stopped it after 5.700 files and an esa-document-index vector size of 10,6gb. This can't be right. Something must be wrong with the settings. If the growth was linear, the overall esa-vector size would be approx. 100gb (53.000 files)...

---++16.06.2010
   * *MW* experiments with UimaLogger to get an better understanding of the CRM data
      * A few emails are empty
      * Some files are in english. (Pipeline has german settings atm. Wiki is also in german)
      * Some of the files are even encrypted?! (Absolutely not readable)

---++ 18.05.2010
I tested a little bit the searching with esa and it surprisingly worked using the generated document_esa_vectors as the input in the TerrierSearcher, that means as EsaPipeline.DIRECTORY_ESA_VECTOR in the function below:

(Lookup in the SVN project "src.main.java.de.tudarmstadt.ukp.manuelwick.dkpro.pipeline.EsaPipeline" or here [[%ATTACHURL%/esa_search_function.txt][esa_search_function.txt]])


The result, e.g. searching for "Modell", was:<br />
Score: 0.0 DocID:src/test/resources/esa_test/documents/schönsten_autos_der_welt.txt<br />
Score: 0.0 DocID:src/test/resources/esa_test/documents/bmw_e60.txt

Searching for "Figur" hit the following documents:<br />
Score: 0.0 DocID:src/test/resources/esa_test/documents/salsa_level4.txt<br />
Score: 0.0 DocID:src/test/resources/esa_test/documents/los_angeles_style.txt<br />
Score: 0.0 DocID:src/test/resources/esa_test/documents/salsa_level2.txt<br />
Score: 0.0 DocID:src/test/resources/esa_test/documents/tango_de_salon.txt

So I think it works  (even if the score always shows 0)
Searching was really fast in comparison with the searching before using the CacheAggregator (now 1-2 secs).
However the documents_esa_output vectors have a size about 31,7 MiB for just 55,7 KiB of documents (9 txt files). Looks really weird to me.


I can upload the complete test-directory to reproduce the results not before that evening. Then you can find the directory in the SVN project and you can reproduce the results by just running one test in the project to make it as easy as possible.

"Evaluation of the results..."
is an important point. We discussed this and you will have to listen to the recordings and record a description of the information need.
The recordings should be identifiable by the same filename as the recording. Please note that caller and agent are on separate channels of the audio file.

We propose a workflow like this:
1) listen to the call and get a picture about the information need of the user (note this down)
2) make a yes/no decision on whether the automatic speech recognition (ASR) output is a "good" representation of the need in the call - this is subjective, but we cannot do too much to it
3) perform retrieval with the ASR results
4) judge topK wrt the info need (derived from the call)
5) calculate p@K 

If you have no idea what a recording is about (what information need the CALLER has), please note them down and skip them.

---++ 29.04.2010
Results of Recording evaluation not as expected. Recordings don't match the given topics. In some cases, even no word in the talk was found

---++ 30.04.2010
Benjamin solved version conflicts with given DKPro components. Terrier can parse subdirectory 108 now. Lucene indexing and searching works. Terrier searching also.
Still problems with ESA - far to slow. Need almost 7 mins to search a query consists of 2 topics. Terrier and Lucene need appr. 4 sec for that.
