"Evaluation of the results..."
is an important point. We discussed this and you will have to listen to the recordings and record a description of the information need.
The recordings should be identifiable by the same filename as the recording. Please note that caller and agent are on separate channels of the audio file.

We propose a workflow like this:
1) listen to the call and get a picture about the information need of the user (note this down)
2) make a yes/no decision on whether the automatic speech recognition (ASR) output is a "good" representation of the need in the call - this is subjective, but we cannot do too much to it
3) perform retrieval with the ASR results
4) judge topK wrt the info need (derived from the call)
5) calculate p@K 

If you have no idea what a recording is about (what information need the CALLER has), please note them down and skip them.

Results of Recording evaluation not as expected. Recordings don't match the given topics. In some cases, even no word in the talk was found

---++ 30.04.2010
Benjamin solved version conflicts with given DKPro components. Terrier can parse subdirectory 108 now. Lucene indexing and searching works. Terrier searching also.
Still problems with ESA - far to slow. Need almost 7 mins to search a query consists of 2 topics. Terrier and Lucene need appr. 4 sec for that.
