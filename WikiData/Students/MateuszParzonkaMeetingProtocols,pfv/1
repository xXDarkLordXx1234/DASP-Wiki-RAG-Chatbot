   * Discussed pipeline layout: 
      * Pipeline should consist of Keyphrase Extraction on subCASes followed by a postprocessing step that filters suitable index entry candidates.
      * Rather focus on Keyphrase Extraction then Named Entity Recognition.
      * Discussed possibility of using "global" information to enhance postprocessing step.
   * Discussed technical details: 
      * Looked at (de)multiplication for subcas-processing. Awaiting demo code for proper UIMA-Settings when (de)multiplying.
   * Next steps:
      * Attapt _KeyphraseEvaluatorApproximate_ to evaluate BOTBI-Pipeline with recall, precision, f-measure
      * Write simple pipeline that processes a whole book and evaluate index entries with gold standard
